  This wig is definitely not for adults. We had several adults try this wig on with it as big as it can go and it still didn't fit anyone. Not to mention this wig is just awkward over all as you no woman could wear it with a wig cap as it sits to high in the back. Definitely not what we expected for how much this wig costs.

  Awesome wig! Got compliments on it all night! Stayed in place. Only have 4 stars because When I have it on my forehead where I want, it doesn’t go low enough on the back of the head, showing a couple inches of hair. I just spray painted the hair pink and it wasn’t a big deal though

  This took a while to finally be available and then shipped. Two rescheduling of shipping at that but this product is pretty nice. I have a shorter 7y.o. boy but nothing like a little fix for the leg length can't help. The Mask is pretty well made although you might need to do a little tweaking. The mask has a foam type attachment to keep the mask level and not have the mask touch the kids face and make them feel suffocated.

  For those all wondering about the sizing - my son is turning 5 in a few weeks. Wears size 5T. I got the medium since there is no option for size small. It’s HUGE on him. I have the arms and legs rolled 3 times! Not sure if I can shrink it or not. Definitely not going to spend more money and get it tailored.  Costume is cute, over priced for costume material. Wish they had more options for sizing.

  I ordered this Halloween costume for my 4 year old grandson. It was available only in a medium at that time.  When it arrived,  it appeared to be way too big. However,  we were able to tack and tuck the hemline. The mask is hard and attaches around the head with a velcro strap. The strap came off the mask completely.  While there were a few minor hangup, my grandson loved the costume and made it look fabulous!

  My son loved the costume. It fit perfectly ( 8 yo 14/16) - he’s big for his age. It’s comfortable and snug but not a lot of growing room. Quality is decent for Halloween costume. Mask looks great. Only a small vent for nose. No vent for mouth but because it doesn’t go completely around the face I think it’s doable and breathable. We only had it on for a few minutes to try on. I didn’t take a pic but will try to update next time it’s on. I’m sure he will want to eat it before Halloween. If your kid likes this character s/he will be pleased.

  If you have a child that is obsessed with Bendy march than we have the same struggle! Of course my 8-year-old wanted to be Bendy for Halloween and upon shopping I found this one.  I LOVED the price and much of the Bendy stuff is over priced in my opinion but this costume was not, under $30 at the time of purchase and it is very cute on him : ) We have made sure not to give it to him before Halloween as the plastic mask is quite thin and easily broken but am happy with this purchase. I knew the material would  be pretty thin but we just layer up the kid and he is excited.  Great costume.

  I bought this for my 6 year old grandson in a size Medium. He is tall for his age (size 8 clothes). There's a little bit of extra length on the legs that is easily able to be clipped up with bobby pins. The added length is great since he'll be able to wear it all year! He loves to dress up as characters. Perfect costume and fit. Very well made.

  This witch costume is seriously cute.  One of the benefits of ordering online is that you can almost guarantee no one else will have your costume if you pick the right one.  My daughter loved this from the first time she saw it and you can't beat the price.  The detail is great and the colors are bright.  It's a velvet-like material.  It's cold at Halloween where we are, so this was perfect as the sleeves are 3/4 and I could add tights and legwarmers underneath.  My daughter uses a wheelchair, so we bought lights to go on her wheels (green to match).  She was a show-stopper!

  This costume is well made and better than what you can find at some stores for $25. My daughter is 3 but 39 inches tall. I got the size 3/4. The length is perfect and right above the floor. It doesn’t drag at all. With someFlat boots it will work great and she can also grow into it for dress up. The fabric is so soft and well fitted. She’s so excited for Halloween.

  My daughter saw this costume and wanted it. It's super worth the money as the big box stores make you pay way more for cheap fabric. This dress is gorgeous and has crushed velvet sleeves and the hat is just perfect. We received thousands of compliments on this costume. It's also thick enough to not need a coat over if you live in Southern California. However layering underneath it would be super duper simple and you could still look amazingly witchy. My daughter loved it from the photos, loved it on, and rocked the costume with all her power. The dress is cute enough to be worn for dress up other times of the year and the photos will be priceless to you as they were to our family. I recommend this one million percent and will buy costumes from this seller again as they are just absolutely stunning quality!!!!!!!!!

  This costume is adorable. My daughter loved the cat on it so she chose this costume. A couple of reviewers said it wasn't very puffy, but ours was. I puffed it up after taking it out of the bag. It is true to size in my opinion, but my daughter is tall for her age (3 years old) and the 3T/4T did drag on the floor when she was barefoot.I took a star off because of the hat. It doesn't stay on easily. When I had her try everything on a few days before Halloween, the hat fell off 4 times in 5 minutes. That was not going to work. I had some black fold over elastic so I sewed some on the hat to make a strap under her chin. It took less than two minutes, but the hat was perfect after that.

  My daughter freakin' loves this thing. Its well made and it fits her perfectly. She's two but she's tall. She has worn it for weeks before and after Halloween. The front of the skirt was a bit long for her. She is about the size of a typical three year old, from what I've seen of them, and I say this because I want other parents to be aware that it may touch the floor. This was not a problem, for the most part. The bottom layer of the skirt has begun to tatter and she tripped on it a couple of times, so I hemmed it up a bit. It is a wonderful costume. Everyone said she was the best witch they'd seen. (from what I saw, it was the best costume, though). I would absolutely buy this again.

  This costume was AWESOME!! I was shocked!! I always make my kids and grandkids costumes and am super lucky about them but I saw this and gave it a chance and cannot get over how well made it was, how cute and the quality of the fabric and the fit -- my granddaughter is 18mos, wears mostly 24mos or 2T -- I ordered a 2T in this and it was perfect length and body!! I separately ordered a teen size orange crenolin to add to it -- the teen size would have been for a short skirt on teen girl but it fit my toddler like a strapless dress and worked perfect -- I would recommend doing, it's the only thing that was missing! So cute, so many compliments!! And she is still wearing the hat two weeks later, just to play in ... she loves it!!

  Got these dresses for our 2 year old twins for Halloween. The quality was better that we thought. And they are super adorable. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the mesh fabric gets snagged on everything and starts to unravel, this can be a little messy. But our twins loved them and still play with the hats all the time. Better than Walmart costumes.

  We purchased this costume for our 2 year old to go trick or treating in. She loved it! It has a little kitten on the apron and the hat is very comfortable for her (it's soft all over). It was cold so she wore it with black leggings and a black turtleneck. Everyone thought she looked adorable (which she did!). The only thing that I would complain about is that the skirt looks very full in the picture. It didn't look nearly this poofy once she had it on. You'd need some sort of an underskirt to get the effect in the photo. But it was still really cute and she loved it... she still has to wear the hat every once in a while!

  My baby girl was the cutest witch I had ever seen. She got so many complements on how cute she looked and I'm pretty sure her favorite part of the costume was the hat. The only thing I would suggest is adding a strap of some sort on the hat it kept falling off, which was very dangerous with all the cars and traffic coming through. We live in a small town where everyone trick or treats on the same street so stopping to pick up her hat every five seconds was a little tedious. Overall, the costume fit great and she loved it and so did everyone that saw her in it.

  This worked out perfectly for a mommy And baby witch costume. It’s also machine washable which is a plus. My machine probably doesn’t agitate as well as some of the newer ones, I’ve got an older model so you might want to put it on gentle. Also hang to dry. I was very happy with this purchase.

  So my daughter wanted to be a witch this year for Halloween. I ordered a size 3 to 4t and it fit her perfect. That’s usually what she wears so I’d say it’s true to size. Wasn’t itchy, she didn’t complain at all. The hat however is kinda big and flimsy, so it falls off.

  We purchased this costume based of off its reviews, and we were not disappointed. We wanted to avoid a costume that would fall apart or not match the pictures. The last thing I want to do is have to try to fix something that I spent money on. This costume arrived quickly, and matches the picture. The black material is warm, and the seams are nicely stitched (i.e. won't come apart). The hat is the perfect size for a toddler, without obstructing vision. The sleeves are a tiny bit long for our two year olds, but it still looks nice, and I don't see it being much of a problem because the sleeves are artistically shredded at the ends for effect. The dress goes down to my daughters' feet (one is 38 inches tall and the other is 36) but they should be fine with shoes on. This dress is made well enough to wear more than once (for parades and Halloween) and we will probably keep it out for dress up for the next year or so. If you have twins, and want to coordinate, there is another one in purple...

  This is exactly how my 3 year old wanted to look on Halloween.  It is unique and interesting.  The costume fits her well (She's a small 3 year old, but it could fit a wide range of kids).  The photo does appear that there is more tule underneath, actually, there isn't much, but she loves it.  Great deal too.

It appeared cute in the picture, but when received, it was cheaply made and my daughter wasn't impressed (for a 4 yr old that's pretty bad).  It was very hard to get it wearable after it being crammed in an envelope from shipping due to the material it was made out of.  Also, the hat was a wrinkled, flat mess.

  Quality costume. Its advisable to wear an undershirt though, its not the softest of fabric. I purchased this along with ""Room on the Broom"" (a children's witch book) , to hype up my little one even more, worked like a charm. It is true, not that I didn't believe you Amazon community, but the dress falls flat. I'm sure a little tulle can fix that right up though. My child wears a size T4 and I purchased 3-4, it fits wonderfully for now but I foresee it not lasting, I should have gone with a size 5. Anywho, I recommend it.

  I'm in love with it! It fits perfectly. I'm 5 4'' 125lb and ordered a small (I am a regular small. I've read the reviews about getting one size bigger, but I just orderd my regular size). The colors are really great. The sewing on the collar wasn't the best but it really doesn't matter once you see it all together. Everybody loved my costume! It came with a few weird yellow stains but I was able to easily remove it with a Tide-to-go. The hat is kinda too big and since is made of foam, it is kinda too light to stay in your head the whole time, especially with wind. A wire would really help to make it stay in the place. Gave 4 stars just because of the stains and the hat.

  I am 5'0"" and 110 lbs. I ordered a size SMALL and it fit perfectly!!! Comfortable material, cute, and my 3 y/o son loves to see me wear it!Minor flaws: it needs a couple of extra Velcro along the back. The gaps are a little big, but if I wear a white camisole underneath, it'll work. Also, the ""belt"" (it's just printed on) in front does not wrap around to the back of the costume, meaning there's no belt design on the back. Yeah, lame. I'll probably wear my own belt to complete the look.

  Costume is you basic costume store outfit that you would buy at a Halloween store. It fit as described but I returned it because the hat was smashed in the center and there was a red/pinkish small stain on the leg. I bought this to wear for a work group costume contest, so luckily I am crafty and was able to put one somewhat similar together very last minute. They did ship quickly so that's always a good thing.

  Two stars for vibrant colors...and that's about the only positive thing about this costume. I ordered a ladies size medium and this jumpsuit was just barely long enough for my 12yo daughter at 5'1"" and was almost too tight throughout the body and legs...she is 110 lbs. So the sizing definitely runs small. The seam holding the ""belt"" to the ""shirt"" came apart. For no known or apparent reason...the pants had several different runs in them just as you would find in panty hose. The hat was bent terribly because of the way it wad packaged.

  I ordered a size small toystory jessie costume from amazon.com through costumes4less on wednesday morning the 26th, When purchasing this product in the buy section I made sure to purchase this product with a 1 to 3 day shipping to make sure that it was there by saturday the 29th the latest.  My son really wanted me to dress up with him this year, and i was increadably excited to be Jessie with my little man being Buzz Lightyear.  After purchasing this product I went to check the status later that night after getting off work around 2am to find that the guarenteed delivery by the 28th had changed to anywhere between the 28th and november 2nd, I was then very disapointed in this company, no one wants to recieve thier halloween costume the day after halloween, expecially when they paid the extra money to recieve this costume in time.  I periodically checked the tracking on this product to find that it was in NC from 3am to 11pm without moving then the same thing the next day in SC then in GA for a whole day also, in my life I have never recieved such bad customer service, for when i called costumes for less they said it was only an ordering answereing service but i could call back on monday (HALLOWEEN DAY) to speak to someone who could handle my call.  Had I known that this would be the way everything would be handled, I would NEVER of purchased this item.  I probley would of accepted it had it arrived on halloween so I could go trick or treating with my little one in costume, but it arrived on November 1st around 1pm which i quickly told the ups guy that I am refusing this product that had a 1 to 3 day shipping almost a week ago, I am expecting a full refund including the shipping cost since I paid extra and WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM COSTUMES4LESS AGAIN.

  Front looks great, but I was so upset that the back is solid pale pink and not patchwork pattern. What was I supposed to do, walk around with my back to walls all night? Received the costume in too short of time to do anything about it before Halloween. The yarn wig was good quality and fit my large head (hat size 7 1/2) and I have very long thick hair that fit easily under it braided. Dress was very thin material, needed to wear clothes underneath since the back was see through. Fit as expected.

  So very disappointed, this product has the same patchwork as we needed. However, the back is a full length pale pink. Why would you not disclose that information. It’s like putting together two absolutely different dresses. Needless to say we can’t use this costume. What a ripe off, we paid for the item and then to ship express, because of timeline. To get this, I sure hope this helps another shopper. Now where to get this costume for a school project by 10/16/18? What a HUGH disappointment.

  The fabric is very thin sheer and not as bright or as thick as the picture. Back of dress is pink and see through. The product details should include that it has a tie back and is pink. The wig is worthless. There isn't enough yarn to cover your whole head and only sewn in one area. You look like a balding Sally.  Not to mention, it fits really loose. I had originally bought the accessories at a costume store, and very glad I did since they are sold out now. The wig I got was $20 and 100 times better from the exact same brand. This package costume is worth $19.99 at most.  It is too late for me to return at this point and get a new dress, the costume store has one for $50, but it isn't shaped right. If you are going for easy and on the cheap, this would work, but if you want to look good right out of the package, this is not the buy for you.

  I'm 5'5 and 123 lbs. I bought the size small (7-9), and if fit as I expected. It has no shape but there are ties in the back that you can use to make it more fitted. Unfortunately for me, the placement of those ties were way below my natural waistline so I didn't use them. I actually just ended up cutting them off. The back of the dress is all one solid color of light pink and is very sheer. If you wear the dress loosely, though, it may not look so sheer. Overall, I'm satisfied with the costume and glad I bought it. I also didn't use the wig as others have posted. It was too thin so I bought a different one.

  I was looking for an inexpensive Sally costume to alter so my husband could do a gender bend without me doing much sowing. I foolishly didn’t read the reviews! If I had I would have discovered that the costume is only Sally from the front! From the back it’s just pink. Who wears half a costume? Seriously? I’ve bought Disguise costumes before, so I understand that it’s not the best fabric, but they always finished the pattern before. I don’t know what happened here. So unless you intend to stand with your back to the wall, this costume sucks hard core! Do not waste your money.

  I bought this costume for Halloween as it seemed to be the only Sally costume that looked true to the movie version rather than the short skirted, ""sassy"" or altered versions. I'm 5' 8"" and 135"" and a 38B and the large fit well. I think the medium size would have been a little too tight and I can adjust the back with the ties to make it more form fitting if I want to. The only thing I didn't like about the costume is that the back is just a thin, pink material. You would have thought that the manufacturer would have used the same pattern in the back as in the front. Even if I had to pay a bit more, it would have made the costume 5-stars. I also didn't care for the yarn wig, which I replaced with another wig. The stitch sleeves come with the costume and it is a nice overall costume for a few hours of Halloween fun.

  This costume is great for the price - I personally have no issue with the back being a solid color, it doesn't take anything away from the costume.  The tie makes it adjustable.  I'm 5'5"" and 145 pounds and the large fits me, while I typically wear a medium.  The wig can be easily pinned to your hair and while the back doesn't offer really full coverage, it does the job and I liked it. I was happy to find a Sally costume that wasn't slutty that I could wear to work - this is the most authentic version you'll find.

  I'm 5'11"", 185# and the 12-14 fit pretty good. I also ordered the Jack T-shirt in case the dress didn't fit. The T-shirt looked really good on my wife and she ditched her dalmatian onesie to be Jack. Maleficent looked great on my daughter.The Sally outfit was reasonably priced.  I'm going to get my money's worth by saving it for next Halloween. The arm covers and high neckline with the ghastly green and sutures  are nice touches so I didn't have to apply suture makeup.I'm at the age where a girdle would have improved my midline.

  I am 5 feet tall and 175 lbs and this fit fine. It was missing some pieces and was pretty basic so I returned it. I wanted  something better quality. The back is solid pink and not patterned so I thought that was pretty lame. If it was a kids costume it may be acceptable but not costume party where my husbands costume (Jack) was on point.  if I was just handing out candy or whatever it would be fine but it just didn't make the cut for me and my expectations.

  This was our first Halloween in our new neighborhood so we decided to dress up as Jack and Sally. The costume was fine for just sitting out on the front porch to hand out treats. I bought an extra-large size because I needed to wear thermal wear underneath my dress. Yes, it was VERY COLD that night! Quality was as expected - this was a one-night costume, not a party dress. I would not have been as happy if this were used for a costume party, where I would be up and walking around. Kind of cheap. The yarn wig was adequate.

  This fits as expected but only because I read the other reviews. Also, when I read other reviews that mentioned the back panel was all pink, I thought they meant just the back but actually the whole back side of the dress is pink and see through. The wig is more of a Raggedy Ann style and is totally bald - like a reverse mullet. I bought a different wig for the costume and was again grateful for all of the other reviews so I wasn't surprised. For a costume company this item was made very lazily. Also, it is printed so would it have been so difficult to just print on the back too? All in all, it is a great costume which is why I rated it four stars. It is very comfortable.

  I was very excited to get this costume. WARNING TO BUYERS: The entire back of the costume is solid pink, and not even a pink that matches the front. Very disappointed in that. I like the fact that it came with the wig and gloves, although I won't be using the gloves. The wig is made of bright red yarn sewn onto a piece of red material for the cap. Please be aware the amount of yarn on this wig is so sparse that you see the wig cap all over. I will be adding more yarn to cover that problem so for me it's not a huge issue, just a inconvenience. But if you are not able to spend the time doing so I would recommend getting a regular wig instead. I have made in the past a complete yarn wig (cap included) for my Rainbow Brite cosplay so this is not new for me. If you are going to add to this wig, please keep in mind, it is very time consuming. This is not something to do last minute. I just wish I would've known that the back of the dress was solid, I would have ordered the largest size and altered it to fit and the back would be covered using the extra material. Disguise Costumes, I recommend adding a back view of your items, as the front view alone is very misleading.

  Not as described. The ascot and arms are blue, not white. Now trying to find face paint to match as the white I already purchased won't work. The wig is made of yarn, I ordered a higher quality one.  I was surprised at the low quality of the costume as it is a licensed product. Very thin and not well made. The Velcro dots that close the ascot are marginally  attached. Pieces were scattered in the box, the plastic bag it should have been contained in was torn at multiple places. Had to be placed in the box that way as the shipping box was in perfect shape. Should have just sent it back, but time is running out for when I need it, so I will just improvise where I can.

  This is a Juniors size, not a woman or kids. It does have a tie in the back, with the back being a solid color. The picture looks like the neck piece and gloves are white but they are the perfect Sally color. The wig is nice and full in the front but if you don't arrange it properly in the back you will see the attached cap that holds it on your head. For the amount of stuff you get I would say the price is not too bad but for the quality I would say it is a little high. But if you are looking for a Sally costume that is not overly sexulized the higher price is worth it.

  This costume looks like the pic. It can be adjusted with ties on the back and fits true to size. The colors are somewhat dull and the wig does not look at all like the photo, it is just long yarn attached on the top, leaving some visible gaps that don't look so nice. It is worth it to invest in red yarn and fill it up a bit. Yet for the price it's a nice buy. The sleeves are loose so plan on putting some elastic or something to stop them from riding down your arm. The neck graphics on our costume were off so that kinda sucks because we'll have to camouflage with paint and try to make it all look nice. Like I said, not bad for the price but not wow either.

  I give this costume a fair rating. The front looks good, but it would have been great if the back matched it. The back was just pink and plain. I wore a long red wig that reached all the way to my hips, so the back of the dress was mostly covered up. I recommend buying another red wig since the one that came with the dress is a patchy, yarn wig. After that small modification, the Sally dress was a hit!

  The costume came exactly how I expected it besides the fact that the white part of the costume is green!  I even ordered white face paint apparently for no reason!  Other than that it's fine, it does run a little small in size and the wig that other reviews complained about was fine.  The wig is exactly how it looks in the picture and so is the costume besides the white being green.  The back of the costume is a sheer pink but not see thru by any means.  All in all for the price and for being for only 1 day its doable.

  The back was a slightly shear strange Pepto Bismo pink color rather than having the same print as the front and the wig was sparse.

  My 13 year old thinks it's great. I mean -hey it's a halloween costume, not some big deal fashion item. The back is pink, but it didn't matter much because since it is a bit big for her, we are just pulling the tie across the back tighter. And yes the wig could be a bit better-more populated with yarn. But it is a better costume than the discount department store ones for 20-30 bucks so I'm happy.

  I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this. I didn't realize until I got it that the entire back is one large piece of pink fabric (which, by the way, is NOT shown with the product image like it should be). I ended up cutting it in half and sewing the front pattern from the bottom half to the back of the top half to make a shirt and cover up the pink. The wig was unwearable. The yarn was too thick and clumped in patches. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a more suitable Sally outfit.

  The costume arrived quickly, which was appreciated. Its important to note that only the front of the costume has the patchwork print, the back is just a solid pink. I wonder how much money the manufacturer saves by not using the print for half the dress? If it was going to be solid, it would have been better for it to be a dark color. The dress did start to run in more than one place at the bottom where the dress is cut in a jagged cut (it is not hemmed) and this was after just wearing it once. The quality is not the best for what it costs, but perhaps that is what you expect of a halloween costume. Maybe we should expect more. My daughter was still excited to have a Sally costume.

  The concept of this costume is great, but the designer really cut corners in the design and materials that were used. The material is thin and more shear than is decent. The back of the dress is a solid color instead of keeping it consistent with the front of the dress. Though I understand why they put in the high neck (so you wouldn't have to do the neck make-up), it makes the look of the dress seem off. The gloves were fine. The wig was terrible!! There was barely enough yarn on it to cover the head bag it was attached to. I would have had to go out and buy more yarn and sew it on myself to get a proper look. When I buy costumes all I want to do is add accessories- not buy more materials to improve the product I paid for. I would recommend making your own Sally costume if you want something decent. The Standard and the Sassy Sally are worth the money.

  I am so excited for Halloween this year.  I usually have no clue until literally days before and then I am ""stuck"" with whatever I can throw together.  I got a size up and yes I could have fit into my regular size.  I did this because I wanted to be able to wear leggings under the dress because sometimes it is a tad cold here on Halloween.  Yes, the back of the dress is a solid pink but it just a costume and one at a decent price.  Yes, the wig could use more yarn.  Personally, I think you could add more to it pretty easily if you are even the slightest bit crafty.  I am just going to wear it as is.  I am a school teacher and I think my students will love it and not really care about the wig.  This will not be winning any Cosplay awards but then that is not its purpose.  I am going to wear it and totally enjoy my day!

Had my daughter try it on for size and that when I noticed there’s a huge stain on the side of the dress like someone had worn it and spilled something all down one side of the dress and sleeves. Plus the back of the dress was defective with some of the gold foiling on the back. Horrible! The tags are still on it but it’s obviously been worn!!

  This is a beautiful costume. My daughter wore it on Halloween. The back got pretty muddy but with a bit of soap and handwashing, it cleaned right up. My daughter had just turned 6, is slim and athletic. She was able to wear this size over leggings and a tee to wear outside.I only wish it had a zipper instead of a velcro back. The velcro will stick to the satin skirts leaving pulls.

(I have bought 4 disney princess dresses for my girl.)The decoration on the arm keeps scratching the patterns in the purple section of the dress, so compared with Anna or Snow White address, this Mulan dress would not last very long.

  I just ordered this for my granddaughters 4th bday gift as she loves dressing up as the Disney Princesses. What really IRKS me is the size 5/6 (likely most popular) is more expensive than  the LARGER sizes which obviously require more material. Just another way Disney exploits the wallets of (grand)parents. I will update my rating after I receive the dress

  Great quality costume, metal badges. Stretchy material. Super cute, gotta get handcuffs separate, though. Got those for like 3 bucks at Wal-Mart. I think some reviews said the hat looked like a bus drivers, made me laugh when I saw it, kinda agreed but once you put the badge on it, didn't even think about it again. Wasn't the best made hat, but it's just for Halloween and it didn't give me any trouble all night. Was super on the fence for sizing, most reviews said do one size up, a few said go TWO sizes up. I figured this brand was just like all the teeny costumes I've tried on in Halloween stores so I ended up getting the XL instead of L. Was able to slide it on without even undoing the zipper in the back, like I said, very stretchy. Was still form fitting, even if I had gotten the L, I still would have been okay but it would have been tight and maybe a little shorter. Also didn't think this costume was super short either. I'm 5'5-5'6 and I usually wear a 9/10.

  worked great with my gorilla suit as harambe and the cop that shot him (fact check: it was the zoo that fired  on him,  but who wants to be suduced by a zookeeper? ) anyway the costume is stretchy and hugged my girlfriends' athletic curves well. The badges are metal (surprise). Although I'm a guy I would say If your bust is less than a B cup you'll probably want to wear a top to preserve ones modesty - other than that if you're looking to be a naughty copper this costume works

  This dress is made of quality material through out the body.  The collar area is cheaper, but it works.  The dress fits pretty close to size.  There is a bit of stretch in the material so it is comfortable to move around or sit in.  The hat, belt, badge and name tag all came with it.  I ordered the glasses the recommended too and they were worth it.  They are decent quality, especially for the price.

  I was absolutely pleased with this outfit when I got it. Unlike a lot of these costumes, this one is longer (hits at my lower thigh and I have LONG legs) and is made of quality material. In other words, you don't look like you just stepped out of a porno (definitely a good thing if you ask me). The dress fits very nicely. I am 5'8"", 150 lbs, 36C and I ordered the XL. It fits perfectly and is comfortable. If you like the skin-tight look, don't order a size up. If you want to be comfortable, do.No cuffs, shades, or baton included, just FYI. Dress, belt, hat, two metal badges, and name plate all included.Honestly I almost wish the dress didn't have the police emblems on it...I'd wear it as a ""little black dress"" if it didn't! It just has a very, very flattering fit--especially for curvy girls!Very pleased over all and looking forward to sporting it!

  This is a really cute costume made with decent fabric however I found the Small too short for someone of my height (5'0 ft). It does hugs nicely but is more revealing than you'd imagine. I'm a 32DD and found the top a little more revealing than I'm comfortable with (About as much coverage as a demi bra) but overall I'm pretty pleased with my purchase! If you don't mind the cheesy collar fabric, VERY short length, and slimming hug, I'd recommend this! Buy a size up!!

  This runs 2 sizer smaller. I'm usually a XS or a S but I have to order M and it is still somewhat small. The hat does not look like the picture and looks awkward in real life. It does not come with the stocking and the stick so you may need to buy those in addition to complete the look.Since the costume runs small so it is really tight and looks like the picture. Just remember to add 2 size or 3 to your normal size and it should be good

The quality of the materials  from the dress to the badges are awesome, despite most Halloween costumes being flimsy and cheap.-The Dress is form fitting but does not over-do it with tightness. It's sexy, but not overly short so that if you bend over you see everything.-The Belt is a perfect touch to this outfit, but I just wish it had more holes so I could have made it tighter to fit better.-The Hat was just right for my head, but I found it a little bulky.All in all, you'll definitely get the bang for your buck!

  In the costume world the rule is go up a size. I normally wear a small or medium 6-8 depending on the brand so I ordered a large. It fit me perfectly.  It is a stretchy material def not 100% polyester. If you're a size 10 I suggest going up a size.The dress belt and badge look great! The hat is better than those found in many costumes but dsnt sit perfectly like on the model. But overall I love it.It is a mini dress.

  This is a great costume!! The only suggestion for people looking to buy this, is that it does run a bit small. I have read suggestions from others to go two sizes up your regular size. I am typically an XS or SM and I ordered a Medium. I am 5ft3in tall and it fit perfectly, not too short. It includes the dress, belt, hat with badge, as well as an additional badge for the costume itself, and the name plate. The hat was cheaply made and way too big for my liking so I went with a black baseball cap instead.

  This costume is really cute. It's made out of a nice form-fitting stretchy material. The length was not too short like some other sexy costumes. My only complaint is the sizing. I normally wear a size 8-10 and weigh 150 lbs. I'm 5 ft 10. Looking at the size charts for dream girl brand, I should fit into the large. Well I ordered extra large just to be on the safe size but it was still a bit too tight. I could've worn but not comfortably. I would say extra large would fit best for 5 ft 7-5 ft 10, up to 30 inch waist, 36-38 chest, up to 38 hip.

  Wow! Can you imagine one of these police ladies coming towards you? Maybe if she pulled you over, it may make for a fun night! YEAH RIGHT- Buddy, that's only on the internet.This is a horrific female stereotype. Police officers are here to serve and protect. They risk their lives on duty every day for the general public. No police officer would show that much skin. Need to do a high case on foot? Gurl - not in them heels you're not. You know what else is sexy? Getting handcuffed! Getting arrested! So much fun! We should sexualize this for the fun of a holiday that was never meant to be sexy, or any other time. If you're on duty, what if you get shot? I am telling you sister (or brotha', if you're into that), that push up bra is nothing like a bullet-proof-vest. Police batons? They were outlawed many years ago for a reason.

  Do buy. You will not be disappointed. This was exactly what I was looking for. She matched her twin who dressed as Mickey for a Disney trip. She doesn’t do well keeping head bands on so Purchased Minnie hairtie ears. But the whole outfit is of great quality I’ve already washed and hung to dry and still looks great. I was a little worried about it being a bodysuit as other reviewers noted is hard for changes. We are potty training so I was going to cut it out and decided not to. I figured it would stay down better with it since after we got it I realized there was a good lift on the tutu part. And honestly it wasn’t that difficult to pull al the way down the few potty trips we made it has a good stretch to it.

  How adorable is this? We had a costume day at school, and this was perfect. Excellent quality, it rivals Disney costumes.  It is soft and comfy.  However-I did cut the built-in leotard pants out. I couldn't see taking off the entire costume every time she needed to go to the bathroom!? It was an easy fix.  She wore black tights and white cotton bloomers.  In the pic she is wearing a black cardigan over it, and I bought the real Disney ears on Amazon. We also layered a full slip with tutu skirt that she already had for comfort and to give more pouf to thr skirt.Fit: granddaughter is 2 1/2, 36"" tall, 29 pounds, and 2-3 fit perfectly with a little room.  I think the 3-4 would have fit ok, but I didn't want to risk the 3-4 being too long and detracting from the pouf skirt.

  Very easy to put on as the black fabric has a lot of give and is basically a one piece suit. No buttons or zippers which also helps with it fitting like a glove.  The black tulle of the skirt has quite a bit of stiffness to it so it keeps the shape beautifully yet five is a beautiful bounce when my toddle walks.  Another, older girl asked me how does the skirt do that with great admiration in her eyes.The only thing that is a bit sub par are the ears - not awful though.  Obviously Minnie Mouse has black one with a bow but even if we put that aside they look a bit cheap: foam circles about 1/4 of an inch thick covered in fabric.

  I used this for my daughter for Halloween and it was a hit! It’s a super cute dress that fits true to size. The only complaint I have is that it does have a built in “leotard” bottom (think like a one piece bathing suit). Which is fine if you’re using this for dance but for Halloween I ended up cutting that part out (the skirt is sewn above it so you can cut it out without noticeable damage) because taking off the entire dress to go to the bathroom while trick or treating (and wearing tights because it was cold) was just something I didn’t want to do.

  This costume fit my (almost) 2 year old perfectly. The quality was pretty good especially for a costume. A lot of the time you get cheap costumes from a halloween store and they are thin material that is not comfortable and this far exceeded that expectation. With that being said, this isn't totally on the same level as what you might get from the Disney store, but still nice. Overall it worked really well. My child looked super cute as Minnie Mouse and the ears were cute though polka dot and not the traditional black with a bow. I would definitely recommend taking a chance.

  I am biased, but my daughter looks frickin' adorable in this. I ordered the 2T, because she'll be a 2T when Halloween comes around. She's average-sized for her age and it fits perfectly. One drawback is the headband is for a kid with a bigger head (her head is also average for her size- she's in the 40th percentile), and the headband falls off. Hopefully that will fit in October, or we will find a replacement. All-in-all great quality and really cute.

  My Daughter is 2,5 and it fitted perfect. I bought the 2t - 3t because they recommendations suggested 2t-3t for her age. My daughter is tiny and still wears 18months or 24 months with carters clothing and therefor I was scared it would be too big. But it fitted perfect. The black fabric is stretchy. It is very comfortable and it doesn’t look cheap! This is a great buy! She wore it 3 times this halloween and you know how kids are! Conclusion:  Great buy!

  I ordered this particular dress for my toddler party, she is in love with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, so I thought about dressing her for her theme party. She was really happy when she saw it and happier when she wore it. The only thing I dislike about it was the ears. It was not exactly matching with the dress but since I ordered different ears that matched, it made the dress look amazing. The dress fit true to size.

  It was really great quality and the headband is perfect. Ita a onesie type dress though. With no snaps on the bottom. So the kid has to go in through the neck hole. I ordered a 2T-3T and received and XL however. Very disappointed in that. Make sure you order well ahead of time because I recieved the day before halloween and it's way too big. No time to replace.

  So,so cute! My daughter is 7 months, I got the 12-24 and the fabric is so versatile that she can wear it just fine! She will also be able to wear it next year because of the flexibility in the fabric. I will probably have to cut out the connected briefs, or ask my mother in law to cut and add snaps.

It's also very warm which may be good or may not be what you're looking for. Do NOT buy if you are tall or have a long torso. The body suit fits those under 5 feet tall

  My kids wanted the whole family to dress as bats this year and I originally selected these Leg Avenue costumes because they have this costume in both kid sizes and adult sizes all the way up to 4X to accommodate my husband.  These costumes are terrific. As other reviewers mention, they are basically a hoodie so this may have been the easiest Halloween ever!  They are long enough to cover the bum so my daughter and I wore leggings and my son and husband wore black sweatpants.  The hoodies are really well made so my kids are just wearing them as super cute hoodies now. Win!

  I am happy with this costume. I like that it has a zipper. I was most hesitant when trying to figure out what size to order. I am no tailor, but I will include some measurements to help the next person decide on the best size.Also the tag specifies to hand wash cold. Only non-chlorine bleach when needed, Line dry, Do not iron. I haven't washed it yet.I'll start by saying that my daughter is 4 years old and about 41 inches tall. I measured her chest at 22 inches and she weighs about 41 pounds. She typically wears a size 5 in little girls clothing. According to the size chart it would have recommended I buy the S/P size for ages 4 to 6. I decided to go up a size and by the medium recommended for ages 7 to 10, and I'm glad I did. The next size down probably would have fit fine, but I'm happy with the extra room at this size.The medium (7-10) costume measurements I took are (approximately)...The  arm and chest length when my daughter held her arms out while wearing it is about 37 inches all the way from from cuff to cuff.The zipper is 21inches long.The seam from the armpit to the cuff is 12 inches.I am trying to add photos, but can't seem to right now.

  My daughter likes this costume because it is basically a fleece jacket with wings. We added glow in the dark glitter glue to the edges and spines of the wings so they would show up better. I bought the glow in the dark glitter glue from Hobby Lobby. Just be warned, if you need to wash it the glitter glue washes off. It'll be warm at least if Halloween is as cold as last year. Fits her a little big but room for clothes underneath.

  My daughter is 3ft 4 and a size xs-s/5-6 brand depending. I ordered a size small to allow growing room and because reviews said this runs a bit small. As you can see the small is a little big on her, im sure a xsmall would have fit perfect. I would say these run true to size, theyre just more fitted. She loves it, its a warm fleece jacket, im sure she will wear it everyday once it starts to cool off. My only concern is how the fur on the hood will hold up in the wash-hopefully well. Would reccommend!

  I was so pleased with this costume for my almost 5 year old son! My son decided he wanted to be a ""spooky bat"" for Halloween and when browsing for a costume to buy, I didn't look at this at first because I was turned off by the stockings/overall styling of the photo. It's really just a nice big fleece hoodie! So easy to put on and you can easily layer if you need to for a very cold Halloween. My son loved it and he got tons of compliments from his friends at school and his friends' parents loved it too. My son is very tall for his age and I struggled with what size to get but thanks to some other reviews I selected a size medium. It was a great fit! Big enough for layering and for him to be able to wear for a while but it didn't look too large on him either. For other clothing he normally wears 5T or boys size 6 for tops. I hope Amazon adds some additional photos of the hoodie by itself and on other kids (both boys and girls!) so it isn't so misleading as it is now with the current photo.

  My son is almost 5 years old and he loves bats. I know this costume seems very feminine but it really is only the top part that you get, which is very cute, warm and best of all not sexy. I wouldn't dress my son OR daughter the way this little girl is dressed. If you omit the make up, fish net stockings and colored hair piece this is an adorable costume for any gender. My son will wear this with black pants and shoes.Anyway, the costume is well made and cozy. It fits tight around the arms so you'll want to use a tight fitting undershirt. I got a size medium because I wanted to be able to reuse the costume for as many seasons as possible. My son is almost 5 and of average height (by American standards) and this costume fits perfectly. I was hoping it would be too big. It is a bit long which is to be expected because I ordered a medium but the arms are just right and next year the arms will be short and the torso will be just right I'm guessing. It'll work fine for us, but I was surprised nonetheless.

  Very cute, nice material, well made, definitely for cold Halloween nights. My only complaint is the sleeves are pretty short. My daughter is 7, slightly tall for her age, but not that much. I ordered a large (10/12) because I wanted her to be able to wear it beyond this year,  but the sleeves don't come to her wrists. She didn't care,  she loves it and will probably wear it everyday until she can no longer zip it up, but no way an 8 year old would be able to wear a large, let alone a 10 to 12 year old.

  This product is well made and the shape looks great. The part of wings are double layered but the hood, body and sleeves are single. My 6 year old daughter is 44"" tall and fits in 6T but depending on brand she wears also 5T or 7T. I read some reviews said this costume runs small, so I purchased large size. It was big for her a little as I expected. The sleeves covered her palms but fingers stick out. She loves it because she loves long sleeves. The hem comes to around her knees but I didn't think it look too big for her. I am satisfied with my purchase.

  I actually just returned this. Daughter was obsessed with being a bat for Halloween, but suddenly wants to be Peppa instead. The costume is well made, and decently thick. Older daughter just turned 3, and the XS fit her perfectly. Tried it on my 16 month old also, and it wasn’t terribly huge on her; sleeves were a little long and it obviously came down further on her. I was pretty excited to put the glow in the dark sparkly glue on it, it’s a shame she changed her mind!

  This costume fit my daughter perfectly.  It was made well and  was very warm for our cold Halloween night.  Something I was concerned about since it was made of fleece was fuzz balls forming/attaching all over it.

I cut up some tights to match the girl in the picture and it turned out really cute.  I'll upload a pic from my phone later.

  This is a really adorable, really practical costume.  I was turned off by the photo with the sexy tights and boots, but the costume itself is basically a hoodie with wings and ears.  My daughter loved it, and it's perfect for cold Halloweens because she could wear it over warmer layers.  With just leggings, you've got a full costume.  It is completely black and I kept losing my kid in the dark, so I ended up putting glo bracelets on her ankles to fund her.  It runs small - the large fit a 6-year old that normally wears a size 5/6.  The only downside is that the zipper isn't great quality and kept sticking.  And it's an original costume - we didn't run into any other bats at multiple Halloween events.

  My Kid loves the hoodie, but for the amount I paid, I didn't realize from the picture the only thing you got was the hoodie, no tights, or boot covers to actually complete the look my daughter fell in love with. You can get those tights but that's $10 and you can get furry boot covers but that's another $12. If you want a complete look this isn't a budget-friendly costume. If your kid is obsessed with hoodies like mine you will get enough wear out of it to be worth the cost because it is ""really comfy and warm""

I would definitely recommend going up a size from what your child normally wears, especially if you live where it might be chilly and want to layer underneath.Can’t wait to show it off on Halloween!

  This was so much more than I had originally expected it to be, it was long for my child but not too long, it is made of some very thick and nice fabric so my child was nice and toasty warm in our 28 degree weather and she loved wearing it so much that she didn't want to take it off. Halloween may be over but she'll be wearing this little jacket/dress thing for a while. Very satisfied.

  Well made jacket in a nice thick material.  Furry trim is a really nice detail.  The ears are not as perky as photoed but otherwise my daughter really like it and wants to wear it as a regular jacket.  It should be durable to pass down - not one of those disposable costumes which I appreciate.

  Love this costume!!! I was hesitant to purchase the 12-18m thinking it may be on the smaller size.... it fits perfectly!!! I can say our little guy wears between 18-24m so these outfits run on the larger side. We also purchased the lion costume 18-24m for our little guy that wears 2T and that also fits well. A little shorter on the height (legs) but the arm length and torso area fits perfectly!!! These costumes are well made!! I love the snaps, zipper, and that the hoods are attached!!!! The inside of the costumes are also soft, no scratchy irritating fabric!!! Only con is they do not offer larger sizes! Would love to continue buying this company's costumes in the future years!!! Hopefully they will consider extending sizes to toddler sizes!!!

  I bought this for my son to wear to the renaissance festival. I knownthe white one is the girl dragon, but I didn't want him to be too hot because we live in Arizona. The festival is in March and temps can be either cool in the 60s or warm in the 80s. The costume is great quality and very soft. The inside lining is a comfortable fabric so it won't make him itchy. I bought a size up in hopes that he could wear it for halloween too. It is a bit big, but I expected that. As far as sizing goes, it is pretty true to size listed. The zipper is nice too cuz it makes for easy diaper changes. I also like that the feet are separate so he can wear shoes with it instead.

  We went to Party City fully expecting to spend $40 on a costume - when we went we disliked all of the ones we looked at (we couldn't try on in store due to COVID). We decided to try Amazon instead and found this cute ""black dragon"" costume for the same price. This costume has exceeded our expectations. It's soft and velvety feeling! It zips up (instead of the buttons or velcro most costumes come with) and is pretty thick which will be great for our unpredictable Northwest Indiana weather! My son is in the 90% percentile for his age and at 1 year old is usually wearing 2T. We ordered the 12-18 month and it fits him great besides the arms are a little short but I chalk that up to my son being pretty huge for his age 😂 most long sleeves fit him this way. We are going to get a (hopefully long enough) black long sleeve shirt and/or hoodie to put under this along with black gloves if needed! The booties are awesome as well! We can fit his shoes inside!

  Very high quality lion costume, much nicer than others! The material is as soft as a nice blanket, so my son is super comfortable wearing it. I like how it's all one piece and the hood is attached (no Velcro to scrape his chin). We ordered three different lion costumes and this one was the clear winner. My baby's a bigger guy- 50th percentile for weight and 90th percentile for height- he's five months old and we got the 6-12 month costume. It's definitely big and a little baggy on him, but would probably fit most babies in the 6-12 month range fine.

  I purchased this for my 27 month old. It was the warmest monkey costume I could find for our cold mid-west Halloweens. It fit pretty well for being a 18-24 month costume (my son is shorter than average). A tad tight lengthwise but it still worked great. The little tail hanging in the back was my favorite.

  This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old son, who is an avid Harry Potter fan. The robe is extremely soft and, and looks and feels much more expensive than the cost. We ordered a M, and the fit was just right. He is slightly above average height and is average weight for his age. The thing we liked most was how the hood had a ""wizard"" point to it that easily stands up without any help! The Hufflepuff crest is nicely detailed and looks great. I have not washed it yet, so I cannot give a review about after washing.

Found this one and was super happy with the quality for a fraction of the price! It’s soft and fluffy. The lined pointed sleeves and hood are a well done detail. The embroidery is really nice too. The overall effect is fantastic and perfect for a HP lover. My son has barely taken his robe off since Christmas morning in spite of it being 70° on Christmas Day in Texas. 😅Very happy with this purchase and my boy has said thank you about 10 times in 2 days.

It’s soft, well made, good colors, thickness, we haven’t washed it yet but he’s worn it around house (cold in Denver) and to bed the past bunch of nights. The hood is soooo cute. No complaints, our son loves it.  Not thinking it will be used post bath, more as comfortable warm layer.

  I'm 5'3 200lbs and 42DDNegatives- the string to tie the center of the chest ISN""T what is pictured. It was too short and wide...also its more of a goldish color and I had to use tweezers to help me string it through the eyelets. The eyelets - some were smaller than others and some were pretty big, some of them weren't in line with the others. It took the entire string to use all the eyelets and once its tied its too pulled together so it takes away the ""sexy"" effect the picture shows...Also, with wearing a bra you will see the bra through that area no matter how tight it is because the eyelets stretch so far and show cleavage. My boobs actually are too big for the chest area and the lone ""belt"" under the chest actually sits ontop on my boobs instead of under where its supposed to be- with a bra its easier to adjust by pulling your bra and boobs up higher and then they set where they are supposed to be but im sure much arm movement and it'll go back to being on top of the. The arms where the holes are cut for the off the shoulder look were a little tight.Positives- The colors were very bright and pretty! the quality of the costume is better than I expected!over all I would recommend this costume but be warned you NEED A SIZE UP! It came fast in the mail but im debating on if I should risk sending it back to order a bigger size and it not getting here or just wearing it since its for a family party and I'll only be using it for one night....

  I wear a size 18 pant and got the women's 1X/2X and it fits well.The plunge line is very exposing. The eyelets for the plunge are very stretchy so the ribbon that comes with it can't really close the plunge the eyelets just stretch. It does not come with the black string that is pictured it is a tan ribbon. I laced it half way up and stuffed the ribbon inside the dress and it looks good enough.The dress is comfortable.Depending on how much dancing you are doing, you may need some shorts underneath but it is long enough to wear without shorts if you aren't doing too much dancing and bending.The head piece is very large, I may have to pin it. It does have a stretch band but unless you have a large head or a lot of hair it will be loose on your head.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, just wish is was a little cheaper.

  This costume is super cute, but the fitting is off. I'm 5'1"" and the length is perfect.  If you are tall, beware, as it will likely be super short for you.  It fits perfect everywhere else (I'm typically a size 6) but it is very tight on the bust (I'm a full C).  I played around with the ribbon to open the bust more and made it work.  I have a small head and the headband is VERY tight.  Just a few tips to help the next person when ordering!

  It is really nice quality for a bagged Halloween costume. It's really super cute on, but it was a little small on me. I generally wear a medium top, even in most juniors sizes. I could zip it, but it wouldn't have been comfortable. It is short, so I'm going to wear bloomers or maybe even leggings under it, but I'm really happy with the look of it! I already purchased the large and am sending back the medium with absolute ease. The seller, Pixie Sparkle, was very prompt and helpful in getting the exchange all taken care of.

   Order this dress for a Halloween party coming up & was very disappointed when I received this in the mail. The dress is suppose to have two cut ups on the each shoulder/arm area. However, the dress I received had a cut out in the arm area on one side and the other side the cut out was underneath the armpit! The material of this dress is also very thin. The fit of the dress itself was nice but it is on the sort side. I’m 5’7 and this dress will be too short to wear at any “family friendly” events. Overall I’m disappointed in the product and would not recommend it.

  My roommate had a Halloween-themed birthday party during COVID stay at home, and this was the PERFECT last-minute costume. The lace-up detail in the front came laced only every few loopholes, and as a bustier girl, I didn’t feel comfortable with that amount of cleavage cover. It was super easy to lace it up fully for more coverage, though!Per recommendations on previous reviews, I did end up purchasing additional accessories and didn’t end up using the included headband.

  First off I’d like to say, but I tend to buy a lot of costumes. Once in a while you find a costume that you to want to wear out in public, not just on Halloween. This is exactly that.  The cut of this dress is so flattering that I would love to take it to a seamstress and make like 20 of these in different colors and materials. In addition, it is extremely comfortable. And to top it off, it’s just really cute and fun. I also purchased a vest with fringe on Amazon that comes with some cool 60s glasses. I plan to wear this with some Minnetonka high suede boots and I think I’ll just feel and look fabulous. At this price you have nothing to lose!

  If you buy a size small and have a bust that is a c or d cup, I think that you'll find that the bodice runs small.  I wear a 34 d and ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.  I wear a size 4 or 6 in jeans, 5'5"" tall.  Waist 27"" or 28"" depending on the brand of jeans if that helps.

  This was your typical Halloween costume. Not the best quality material, but good enough. This dress had a zipper which was nice! Since it's an a-line dress the bottom is forgiving on both sizes. I could've done the medium, but the chest area was way to snug (I'm a 34C) so to be comfortable all night I went with the large and that worked much better. Not as form fitting, but still looked good! I'm 5'5"" and 146lbs if that helps anyone! I did wear a fringe vest which helped a bit with the shortness. (I also wore shorts under it as well)

  After reading some reviews I sized up and got a large, I wear size 6-7 sometimes size 8 pants depending on brand and small/medium shirts. The outfit both shirt and skirt fit me as any sz Large clothes would, flowy/not adjusted to body. Not a deal breaker but medium would've been perfect. I cut 3in off the end of the skirt so that I didn't have a piece of velcro sticking up when adjusting it to my waist and made sure the shirt was pulled down under my skirt so that it looked tighter.I am 5'1"" 136lbs  36B C if padded bra, wide shoulders, thick arms. Hope this helps.

  Just tried on my costume, and it definitely runs small. I'm 5' 2"" and 145 lbs. and I have a booty. It covers my tush, but just barely. Otherwise the costume is exactly as you'd expect. The shirt fits well, and is form fitting so that's a plus. The skirt is velcro though, so if you're planning for a night out, I would suggest finding a way to reinforce it.

  Quality wasn't bad. Unfortunately I had a bit of a difficult time with sizing on this one. While my arms fit well in a Large, my torso is definitely more like a Medium. Ended up needing to take in the sides of this in order for it to fit better and look less boxy. The shirt is a button-up. The tie is simply an elastic band that you put under the collar The skirt is VERY short and strapped on with velcro. Overall, it was a fun costume. I'd say give it a try

  I returned this because the size chart measurements don’t match the costume. The size large runs like a small/medium. Also, for $40 it’s incredibly cheap. The white top is paper thin and itchy. The skirt is a cheap tear away that closes with a strip of Velcro. For the money, I don’t think it’s worth it. This should be like $15-20.

  Shipped to me super fast! Shirt and skirt are pretty snug for a large.. Luckily I bought this to wear in the bedroom for my boyfriend anyway, so it worked out great - he LOVES it! I generally wear medium or small depending on the brand (5'7"" 150lbs 34"" bust) but after reading other reviews I went a size up and am glad I did. I love that the skirt is fastened by velcro...

  I'm a busty woman, 38DD. The shirt was to small. I think even if I got a bigger size, the shirt iwould have still been tight on me. Not a big deal, I purchased another at my local store. As far as the skirt, I have wide hips. The skirt didn't fit around my hips but I didn't care about that. I wrapped the skirt (it's velcrow) around my waist covering belly button & it fit perfect & it showed just the right amt of my bottom as I wanted. The tie fit perfect around my neck. You just slide it over your head. The glasses came w/ no frame. I think the discription stated that. Overall, I love the outfit. The shirt was the only thing that wouldn't fit do to me being busty. It's still worth the purchase.

  I'm 5'4 and 20lbs 'overweight' with a 36D bust. I wear a size 10 dress (in moderately sized brands) I have naturally broad shoulders and ribcage but don't carry a lot of extra weight in my ribcage and I have a smaller waist than most people my size. I ordered a Med/Large and would have been happier with a medium.I have a long torso for my height and the skirt hit 6-8inches above my knee. (I'd probably be 5'8 if my legs weren't so darn short.)I don't blame the manufacturer for this, because I was on the fence about a med or med/large and I figured bigger was better than 'won't zip'. The very long red ribbon gives at least an extra six inches of torso room if loosened. I'm going to have to work with it to get it to look better than my pic does.The area I'm most self conscious of is from 3' below my belly button to the bottom of my hip. Other moms know what I'm talking about. This costume was perfect for covering that area. The part of the top that ends in a 'V' shape doesn't reveal anything I don't like there.This dress fully covers a bra, which was a relief, because it's hard to find a strapless that holds the girls up.The fabric is thin, as you'd expect from a costume. It definitely shows a bra in back. I don't 'bulge' there very much, but it seemed to accentuate what does.I usually can't wear a plastic headband without getting a headache, but the one included is actually very comfortable.The petticoat is not included, which is clear in the description. The secret wishes scarlet petticoat 'often bought with' this costume was shorter than I'd like. You won't be able to see it unless the dress is pulled up, the petticoat is pulled lower than it should be (like my pic) or you bend over, which looks sexy in the bedroom, but I wouldn't reccomend the modest do in public with the dress plus petticoat. (I'm not modest so this'll be fun with a cute pair of undies. 😉)The reason for only 3 stars is the collar. It doesn't just itch, it hurts!! I have soft skin and I'm going to have to find something to cover it where it attaches or my skin will likely rub raw. I couldn't just knock off one star, because it really really hurts. 😕

  I'm 5'10 and 178 pounds and I got the medium/Large. It was a little big around the waist so I could've done with the small/medium but since it was for work, I didn't want to risk it. The front was long enough but since I have a booty, there back was a little short but nothing too bad. I wish it would've came with an undershirt though.

  It is a really nice costume! I'm 5'6"" 140 lbs. My cup is a DDD. I ordered the Small Medium. The chest area is snug, but it doesn't hug my waist quite how I wanted it to. It's a little roomy. However, I have troubles with fits everywhere I go because of my curvy figure. It's a beautiful costume, and I am so excited to wear it! I usually wear a medium in adult clothing, but the small medium was a little big on me. If I were to order the X-Small, it probably would be too small on my chest, but just perfect for my waist. It's a gamble, but when in doubt go 1 size smaller than you think would fit you. Probably not 2 sizes small, and DEFINITELY not a size bigger than normal. Length for me was just like in the picture.

  Really nice costume!! Like the description and other reviews state, you will need to buy the red petticoat separately to complete the look and make the dress fluff out correctly. I was scared it would be too big because of the ""S/M"" and ""M/L"" combined sizes, so I ordered an XS. I am 5'9 and ~135 lbs, 34C. It definitely fit once zipped up, it had a nice tight look around the upper part of the dress above the yellow skirt part which I liked. But, like most halloween costumes, the zipper was a little flimsy so I need help to get the zipper up and it was somewhat difficult. Once on though, it fit nicely and there was some wiggle room. Overall, I was really pleased and it was exactly what I wanted, especially considering the low price!!

  The dress arrived today torn and too large for me. The material is cheap and the dress will make you look wider than you are. Without a petty coat it’s not cute. I would go with another dress that doesn’t have the tie up lace in the front because it makes it look cheap. Overall not satisfied.

  I was Pleasantly surprised when I received my costume. For the price I cannot complain. I’m 53, 120 pounds and I got the extra small and it fit perfect. The material as to be expected, kind of cheesy and cheap but for a costume for a couple nights it works. It was a bit wrinkly so definitely prepare for that ahead of time. It didn’t come with the petticoat, but I highly recommend purchasing one,if not it’s flat and if you search Amazon you can find one cheaper than what they try to pair it up with under the costume.Overall I am very happy with my purchase i’ll definitely be recycling this for future Halloween‘s.

  I would usually get size XS from Leg Avenue, but this time I decided to follow their size chart, which was a mistake. I got size Small, and I was so disappointed when it came and I could easily fit three more outfits underneath. I'm giving this four stars, though, because I wanted to return it but postage costs so much where I live, so I wrote to Amazon and they credited back my payment, and the really nice rep told me through an email that I'm free to do whatever I want with the costume. So I had it altered (I had to take off a LOT by the way, since it really was too big) all around the waist, back, and even shoulders. And it looked so much better after that.

  The model made me feel confident I would not be too busty for this but it showed a lot more cleavage. Having the lace in the front meant getting and awkward crotch bunch in order to cover up my chest. If I was a better seamstress this could've been easily fixed. The white lace is the itchiest thing you have ever encountered and can't be removed without ripping the seams. Would only recommend as a base piece for someone who is crafty. If you want a costume that can be worn out of the bag I would not recommend.

  5'8'' 160lb Guy here. I ordered a M/L and the dress fit exactly how I thought it would. Neckline was not too low but exposed a lot of chest hair. The skirt lies just above the knee, but I was hoping it would be shorter. The corset is fully adjustable like a shoelace, and was actually pretty roomy for a M/L, I might have been able to get a S/M but I didn't want to risk it. The fringe on the top is a little itchy on your neck, but it's not too bad. I would recommend thigh-highs, red pumps, and a petticoat (which is not included), but obviously I'm not gonna invest in those for one night. Looks pretty good for a hairy man in a dress not gonna lie.If I can say it looks good on me, then it would look better on any girl, so keep that in mind.

  Overall I loved the costume and I was super happy with how it all turned out. The skirt portion of the dress is a bit thin and therefore a little see through, but I was wearing white leggings anyway so not an issue (I assume also not an issue if you're wearing the red skirt with it, which I did not purchase). It did need a solid steam to get the wrinkles out upon arrival, but that was no problem. My only issue was the size. I referenced the size chart and I am certainly not a 0/2 dress size - so I went with the S\M and not the XS. I ended up needing to pin both sizes a fair amount but it wasn't noticeable and ending up being totally fine. For reference - I'm 5'3"" and 130lbs. I would happily purchase another costume from the same place, and just go down one size.

  Arrives very fast, and fits well, so it earns its stars. However, the material looks very cheap, and feels uncomfortable, so I ended wearing it painfully. My skin was itchy the entire night. Party City has cheaper and better Snow White, but it arrived too slow. So, if you are not in a hurry, don't buy this one

  This was so cute! I'm a bartender and I wore it for our Halloween party. Order a size down because it's pretty big. Im always a medium but got a small in this based on other reviews. I am 5 foot 4, 145 pounds and a 32 DDD fyi. The material is great for being so inexpensive although it can get pretty hot. I did not wear the hat because its flimsy and honestly I'm not sure how you would wear it. I bought red gloves and red fishnets separately and I think it made the outfit complete.

  I absolutely love this costume! So sexy and fits the curves well. I am usually a medium in costumes but from reading other reviews that said to size down, I bought both the small and the medium to see and the small definitely fit me better. It hugged my curves on the booty and looked great in the chest. Also the peplum skirt hides the tummy area which I love. Looks great! Only thing I didn’t love too much was the hat. It’s really small on the head and falls flat. Looks kinda funny on my head lol but overall the costume is well-made and I am definitely glad I purchased this.

  The fabric was slightly stretchy so it forms to your figure. Very flattering. A little too low cut but you can put something under it if you want. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the zipper is too weak. It split when I was trying it on so I had to reinforce it with safety pins.

  I am 5""8, 140 lbs, and i ordered the Large.  I am familiar with Leg Ave Costumes, and mediums are just too tight.  I should have ordered a SZ med for this one.  So the sizing is my fault.The dress quality is fitting, but the cut, unless you have narrow hips, the second layer over the attached skirt will make you look wide.  it is a cute looking costume though....The hat is cute in the picture but it arrives flat.  I don't know how to puff it up to look the picture, but it is meant to just sit on your head with bobby pins.  I could not master keeping the hat up, maybe you can use cardboard inserts.

The length was great and landed right above my knees. Perfect for a more conservative costume, but still with a little sex appeal!

  Max's wife here:I didn't buy this costume, but I did try it on at a local costume store the other day. It is a very cute costume and I liked the overall fit of it. I am a size 8, usually a medium in clothing/dresses. I tried on the M/L and it had a lot of room. I had to pull the sleeves up because it was big in the arms and the chest/stomach area was a little baggy. The only thing I didn't like was there wasn't much detail. The costume itself is cute, but would need makeup or a tutu/stockings to pull it all together. The dress is actually very thick in fabric, it is a velvet-type dress and is very comfortable. The collar accessory is big, and sat at the base of my neck (I have a very skinny neck in general, so it could've been just me). The hat is very very stiff, but I'm sure it would loosen up once you wear it or handle it. If you have the right supplementary accessories, it would complete the costume. I would add a skirt under and maybe some striped tights if I do decide to buy this costume! It's also long as far as costumes go. I am 6"", and it hit mid-thigh.

  I bought this costume for my 13 year old daughter she wanted to be something different this year. She absolutely loves it. Not only did it ship fast but the material is super comfy and it fit just right she loves it. The only thing I wish it would have included was leggings or tights or something. But no biggy still worth the price

  Das Kleid kam zugig an, sauber verpackt.Ich habe es gleich anprobiert und muss sagen, es sitzt gerade so. Ich trage normalerweise eine Konfektionsgröße zwischen 36/38 und 40. Darum habe ich mich für 38/40 entschieden. Also, es hätte keinen cm enger sein dürfen! Der Reißverschluss am Rücken geht beim bewegen der Arme sofort auf, diesen musst ich jetzt mit einer Sicherheitsnadel verschließen um sicherzugehen, dass das Kleid da bleibt, wo es hingehört ;)Auf dem Foto sieht das Kleid relativ kurz aus, es geht jedoch bis zu den Kniescheiben TROTZ separat dazugekauftem Unterrock der nicht enthalten ist. Dies habe ich in einer Kundenrezension als Empfehlung gelesen und gleich dazu bestellt.  Ansonsten hängt das Kleid ""schlapp"" am Körper runter.Ich denke, für den Abend an dem ich das Kostüm nun benötige, ist es in Ordnung, man muss eben etwas tricksen und hier und da was ändern oder verbessern, aber das ist machbar. Dafür hat man aber auch ordentlich Geld investiert (zusätzlicher Unterrock, Strumpfhose, Perücke... ) und das würde ich mir beim nächsten Kauf nochmal genau überlegen. Das ist ein nicht ganz so günstiger Spaß

  Fällt recht groß aus und ist leider viel zu lang. Ich bin 1,69m groß und es ging mir bis fast über die Knie. Wirkte dadurch leider gedrungen. Schade, denn es ist an sich ein wirklich süßes Kostüm. Außerdem war das Kleid beim auspacken nicht in der Folie in der es sein sollte und hatte vereinzelt blanke (oder leicht verfärbte?) Stellen.

  I love this costume, just as described. I wear a size 18 and was going to get a 1x/2x but was nervous about the size. So I decided to buy 3x/4x after reading the reviews, and it fit perfectly. I got a lot of compliments!! The hat was also perfect, the package came flat but the hat was some type of foam material that molds well and it sort of popped into place and I had no issues with it.

  Looking for something to wear for Pirate Night on a Disney Cruise. This worked out well. I normally wear a 14-16 in dresses. The dress was great. It was very comfortable and not hot. The belt was a bit small. Seemed like it was for a smaller size. Had to modify it just a bit with extra Velcro and safety pins. If it weren't for the belt, I'd have given it 5 stars.

  Good quality and very cute.  Because of previous purchases from Amazon and size discrepancies, I purchased a larger size.  I would usually wear a size Large. I ordered an 1X.

  Although the costume is cute and fit was perfect it looked liked it was used but they said they're stuff is brand new. When you look at the pictures it looks like someone sat on something and then it was snagged. There was even hair stuck to it on a sticky spot. This how it looked right out of the package. Spoke with Michael at Blue Frog and they were quick to respond and take care of me and very professional. So I give the costume a 2 but the customer service an excellent rating.

  This is a really cute costume for being somewhat cheap. I expected it to look cheap but it actually is much nicer than I expected. I wasn't sure on the size but I went true to size and got a Medium. I'm 5'7"" and 135lbs. It fits nicely and is a good length. The belt barely fits and I am on the slender side but I actually like it without the belt. I gave 4 stars because the hat is super squashed from being in the package. I'm going to ""try"" to steam it out but it might not be salvageable. Other then that, really like this costume.

I bought a 4x and i made sure i put on a waist trainer to bring the whole look together and im amazed.  The belt accentuates the waist and the boobs get to come out and play lol.

  GREAT Halloween costume! The fit was great. The quality of the product is amazing. I received nothing but compliments on how everything came together. One of the elastic pieces on the arms was not as strong as the other—so I had to hold it up using a hair tie—but not a big deal at all. Definitely worth the price. Not revealing on the top either, definitely very appropriate. Dress might be a bit short, but wearing tights (to complete the costume) helps a lot.

  I don't know how they managed to take such a great photo of this costume because the costume is complete crap. It's the cheapest crappiest feeling costume but I've tried on in a long time and fits really poorly. Tried it in two different sizes and it wasn't a sizing issue just a crappy costume issue. I would not recommend this to anyone.

  Super cute for the price. Love that you can wear with or without sleeves. The only reason for the 4 stars is the hat. The Hat Quality is poor. Its kind of like a foam/ material. It was squished up on arrival. Kept blowing off my head every time there was a breeze . I will look for a better hat, but the costume overall was great and shape forgiving if you have any tummy ! I wore with fishnet stockings and boots that I had already.

  I was totally cute in this outfit.  I made my own additions. I received so many complements on this outfit.  I couldn't find a hat to fit my big head with my puffy hair, however I made it work.

  I ordered this for Halloween. It fits fantastically, and it is very detailed and fun. I didn't order the leggings or boots to go with it, but used my own, so it is both a little warmer and a little cheaper. Just add a sword and some eyeliner and you're good to sail the seven seas. One thing I'd like to point out is that it did take some effort to figure out how the belt goes on, but I eventually found the Velcro. Great costume.

  I'm 5'8'' and about 130 lbs - usually a size 4.I purchased this in a Large due to other comments, and size chart.It fits well, snug but not too tight, the fabric is fleece-like, has some stretch, and is very comfy and warm. Too warm for an indoor party.The length is strange on me - it's too long as a sweatshirt and too short as a dress. Length would be better on someone 5'4'' or less. I will wear with black leggings because it's so short. However, the length of the sleeves is perfect.The good thing about being tall is the rear fin is coming out of my back not out of my bum. Win!If it had pockets I would give it 5 stars.

  I think this is a nice, well-made costume.  I am happy with the price I paid.  But, as others have stated, this runs very small.  I pretty much always wear a size medium.  Because of reviews, I purchased an x-large.  I am planning to wear this while my husband is a fisherman, one child is a crab and the other a fish.  I ordered the largest size because I would rather it be loose than tight.  I can zip this up fine and it fits like I was hoping.  But, like I wrote, I am usually a size medium.  X-large with this costume is not x-large at all.  I wouldn't advise ordering this costume at all if you wear more than a medium size in normal clothing.  I am happy with this costume but am glad I read reviews and ordered up 2 sizes!The arms are long and loose on me (they look tighter on the model than they are on me).This zips completely open like a jacket which is different than what the current photo shows.I am 5'5"" and it hits me right at my knees, which I am happy with.  I wanted it to be longer on me than the model and figured she is much taller than me.  I am going for just the shark look, not the sexy shark look, haha.  The fin is on my butt.  The zipper in the front makes it look kind of bumpy but I don't mind it.  It just depends on what you are looking for.  If you want a fun, funny costume or one to wear with your kids, I think this is good.Oh, and according to the size chart I should have ordered a medium so I definitely would not pay attention to that.

  Very nice looking. My measurements are 32DD, 24, 39 and I’m 5’4” I ordered size SMALL. I am going to have to hem off approximately 12” off of the waist in order for it to fit but rest fits perfectly. Arms and hips and chest all go in this. It’s warm and comfy so if it’s chilly I will be warm pairing this with gray leggings 😍♥️ definitely the prettiest mommy shark dress

  I love this!!! I have wanted this for a while and I’m like a size 10 now...I still got the extra large to use them as a nightie and since my nickname namesack is Jawz, I just had to have this! I love these fun styles and this brand always fits true to size for me. This style would easily fit sexy if I were a size 14 as well. It’s stretch and the fins hold up nicely. Just don’t cook woth the sleeves down lol, learned that the hard way when a fun flipped a wooden spoon out of the pot and back at me. That’s how great the fins hold up and keep their shape!

  I'm 5'10 and 150 lbs. with a 34B bust. After reading the reviews, I decided to order a large instead of a medium. I'm happy with the fit--snug but not too snug. I probably could have ordered a medium, but the sleeves already seem short to me so I can't imagine how short they would be if I sized down. The dress does come down a bit further on my legs which is nice. Again, I probably would have been ok in a medium but happy with the large. I didn't look at the dress sizes on the size chart, they seemed way off. I just went by measurements.

  I was both impressed and unimpressed with this costume. The sizes run a bit small which is not surprising except for the fact that I ordered another animal in this same line and the other one fit perfect. They were both mediums. This tells me there are no size standereds throughout the company. I am five 5'4"" 142 pounds and this costume was too tight. It stretches and would look the same a size up if you're going for the tight look but wouldn't bunch at the zipper. I did feel it was well built but poorly designed. The fin is not mid back like their picture shows. It looks like it's coming out your rear end. I have attached photos so you can decide for yourself.

  Ordered larger so it was more of a sweater dress than a fitted sexy thing. Great quality and look but my only complaint and reason for the lack of a star is the fin is too low, it’s on your butt instead of your back, so sitting is not an option. Party I was going to wear it to was canceled so I’ll save for next year but I’m going to try to relocate the fin in between now and then.

  Like other reviewers suggested, I sized up. I found it pretty long. The opening for the shoulders and neck is rather wide. The fin on the back is indeed pretty low. It'd be nicer if it was higher up, but it didn't bother me too much. The only actual downside to this (in my opinion) is that it gets really hot when you have it on. The felt it's made out of is extremely thick, and I unfortunately could not wear it out for Halloween (SoCal weather). If you live in a colder area, I highly suggest this, as it'll keep you extremely warm. The sleeves weren't as tight as it's shown in the photo for me. The costume itself is pretty comfortable.

  This costume was super cute, but it didn't fit me.  I'm 5' 5"" and pear shaped.  I tried the medium as it was listed for sizes 8/10 - it fit perfectly in the chest, but was too snug in the hips - it zipped, but puckered at the bottom and didn't look as cute as the model.  Also if you have arms that are slightly longer for your height, go a size up, the sleeves hit me an inch or so from my wrist.It is super cute though, so just order with plenty of time to exchange sizes if needed.

  Really wanted to be a shark, so went with this because I'm too lazy to do a DIY costume. The model, of course, is completely false advertising because it's definitely not what it looks like on the average customer. Fit was a bit poor - I sized up and got a medium and still felt like I was bulging out of it all day and could barely zip it up over my chest (full 34C/32D).

  So for a Halloween costume this will work but it's not what I expected. According to the size chart, I should have ordered a medium but I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. The color is actually a brownish gray which is a bit strange and the fabric is a cheap fleece so eventually it will loose it's shape if not taken care of properly. It is warm so if you are going outside this will definitely keep you warm.

  I was so excited when I got this costume in the mail! I did look at reviews so I went for the large. I have a fairly athletic build and I'm 5'5, a C, and 133lbs. It fits just fine and feels like I ordered a large(not my normal size, realized I put med in my original review for some reason so I changed it) and was glad I did. It ends just above my knees, so it may shorten your steps a bit. I could definitely get another layer underneath there but not much else since it is pretty much form hugging. It is pretty warm. The fin lands at the bottom of my butt and there are elbow fins that are at my elbows. The hood isn't too bad, I have very thick hair, so it should be normal fitting for all. The teeth and eyes were stitched just fine. If I were to say anything bad, I guess I agree about the zipper bunching, but it's honestly not even that huge a deal...look at the costume, lol.

  PROs:• very soft fleece fabric• hood with teeth definitely looks like a shark without looking too much like a children's costume• nice length, comes to about mid-thigh, so it isn't too revealingCONs:• runs small (order 1-2 sizes up)• fin placement is too low so it doesn't look like a fin, but more like a tailI returned this jacket/costume, because of the fin placement — the fin is so low it looks like a tail. Overall I was looking for more of a subtle ""costume"" and the back fin stood out too much as an odd element.

  I bought this to wear for trick or treat with the kids, but I could probably wear it to a grown-up party as well. I bought a medium, which was snug and long on me (5'1"", 132 pounds), making the zipper bunch up.  I tuck the costume up to shorten it, which looks much better.

  I ordered this for me and my fiance's Jaws costume idea. I ordered a Medium because some reviews said it runs small. I thought it was cute, however, the costume is not exactly like the picture shown. It is a lot longer then imagined. It actually went way down past my knees. because of that the dorsal fin sits right on my butt (which I have, so it makes it look even bigger) because of this, I kind of have to pull it up, and it makes it look really bunchy. It zips and unzips all the way down, which has more a hoodie feel then a dress. But overall, this isn't bad. I like the material, it's really soft and warm. For the price, it's pretty good. Happy I found something I'm content with. Better then being Left Shark for sure!!!

  My husband and I wanted to go as a couple so I thought this would be funny parked with him dressed as a banana!I am 5'7 and 130lbs. I ordered the Medium. It looked huge when I took it out of the bag but once on it fit like a glove. I am not very curvy but it hugs in all the right places. Even if I had a large bust it would be ok. I plan on wearing a yellow bra or lacy yellow bralette under it. The tail is kind of heavy but doesn't really bother me. The hoodie part is pretty big. You have to rest it on top of your head otherwise it covers your whole face. A few bobby pins can fix that though. It is a little bit longer than fingertip length but it doesn't look weird unless maybe you are shorter. It would be an easy fix though if you hemmed it.Overall for the money it was what I expected and is really cute. You can make it tame or even sexy which is perfect for the two parties I am going to in it. I also bought the socks this girl has on too. I haven't got them yet so not in the photo.

  I did a ton of research on this before I bought it.  Buying clothes on line scares me, but I'll have to say, I was very pleased with the fit.  I'm 5'2"" 145 lbs and large chest.  I went off the size chart by for bust and it was perfect. If I would have used other measurements, waist etc, it would have not fit.  It wasn't too short on me, was a few inches above my knee.  So just a word of advise, if you're unsure of size, always go by your bust size.  Other than that, very warm and cozy was just a little sad the ears didn't really stand up so it was hard to see the ""monkey"" part of my costume.

It works just like a zip-up robe (something I'll probably re-use as once Halloween is over). I'm 5 ft and it hits an in or two above my knees. Quality is good, but it is thick (fleece like material)!

  This is a really cute monkey jacket. Ordered a medium for my 11 yr old who is about 4'10"" tall. She is very slim. This fits her very snugly down the body with not so much wiggle room although the material gives a little stretch, so I don't think this would fit an average adult female unless she's very skinny with a 24"" waist. Absolutely love the tail and ears on the hood. Very cute n my daughter loves it.  I had to return the first time bc there was open seams on the tail. Quick exchange which I'm happy about so I had time to go costume shopping if this didn't work out. Second one had some messy stitching detail but at least it wasn't infringing on actual costume or making any open seams worst. Overall, very happy with monkey jacket.

  This costume fits strangely. I am 5’2, 113lbs and the small is too tight... the arms are so tight they barely fit and I have small arms. The length of the dress is good. Also the tail is so long and heavy it weighs down the dress and pulls tight on your stomach. Not very flattering. I think I’m going to have to return it to get the medium.

  Cute costume but runs really small so order a size up if not two. It's made out of a fleece material so it's warm...great for cold weather. The tail is a bit heavy so you'll want to pin it or hold it throughout the night. The hood is a bit large and could end up covering your face if not pinned back somehow. All in all it's fine for one night.

  As per EVERY other review on here, the sizing does runs small... I am typically a medium, however sometimes I feel a bit fluffy and was worried so I did order a large. It fit okay. A medium would have fit, but def would have been on the sultry-curve hugging side, so a large is perfect for family trick or treating (it wasn't baggy anywhere).It's really warm, and well made. The tail isn't as heavy as others have led you to believe, and I have big hair so the hood doesn't flop over my face or anything. I'm also 5'8"" tall so it wasn't as long as it might be on other people, not inappropriately short, but about mid thigh. I am REALLY happy with this purchase. It's too cute and a great value!

  The monkey costume arrived promptly and I just tried it on.  I am 5'3,"" 147 pounds and wear a size 10 jean. Oh, boy. The XL has me sucking in my gut when the sizing chart indicated a more roomy fit.  The face of the monkey is blemished with reddish marks and I can't tell if it's makeup (I don't wear makeup) or some kind of fabric dye....anyway, I tried to clean it with a toothbrush dipped in  a bit of laundry detergent but the mark seems to be permanent.  If it weren't so close to Halloween, I would request an exchange but I guess I'll just say the monkey is blushing. As people have mentioned, the tail is heavy so if this is a costume you want to use continually, consider replacing the stuffing with a lighter weight batting. Since I'm short, the hem fell to just above my knees.

I was sweating for the thickness of the costume, but this would probably be a benefit if you live in a colder environment.

  Very comfortable and warm for Halloween! I seriously felt like I was wearing fleece pjs all day. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sizing is very off. I normally wear XS in clothes, but based on other reviews I decided to get a M. The M just fit me. The fabric isn't elastic, so if the fit is too small, the zipper will start warping and bunching up. Other than the sizing, it's a great costume and great quality. I would definitely get another one.

  Got this for Halloween because it's impossible to find a sexy costume that isn't borderline streetwalker - as a mom I like that the zip front allows for my choice of boob exposure. The costume is a bit longer than the photo, but I'm fine with that. It's comfy - the material feels a bit like a thick soft felt. The tail at the back is very heavy and cumbersome, so my simple solution was just to bring it around front and pin it to the side of the dress. I'm 5'10"" and size 8-10, so the large fit perfectly.  Will style with red Converse high tops. All in all I'm happy with the purchase.

  This was a fun costume for the theme party. I'm 5'3. 108lbs. I purchased the small. I bought the net stockings separate. The only thing that was to big on me was the garter for my leg. The garter is attached to the belt so I couldn't just not wear it. Maybe it can be a holster for something but I wore it as a garter. I used a very small safety pin to make it smaller.  Good thing I had that safety pin. It was a little cheeky in the back side but the net stockings helped cover up a little. Had to basically undress to use the ladies room.  The only downside to the costume.

  I like writing detailed & thorough reviews so I expect this to be long. (You've been warned.) I, personally, scroll all over for super close comparison sizes from previous reviewers. If you do that too, I hope this can help.I first searched for a Halloween party type costume on here for my October birthday. I consider myself an average-to-short young adult woman, on the bigger torso side, with no curves or any thickness in any of the right places, and I have no junk in the trunk at all. I'm 5'5"", approx. 160-165 lbs, 36D, wear medium t-shirts, U.S. 13-14 in jeans, and prefer a *little* bit of tight clothing. I ordered a large and I'm super happy. Here's why.To start off, I'm obsessed with astronomy so seeing this pop up on my search was a no-brainer. It was delivered within 2 days, it's comfortable, the silver material is stretchy, & you can pick & choose what accessories to wear with it. I personally chose not to wear the clear plastic hoodie (attaches via velcro) nor the leg garter... yet. (Haven't tried it on yet, I think the costume looks fine without, but I will try it on again later.) I paired it with black yoga pants underneath for warmth, modesty for the rump, & at the recommendation of previous reviewers. (I'm wearing the leggings AND butt pads also from Amazon too, and this costume STILL is big in the back side. Not hugely though, it doesn't get in the way or expose your whole cheek or anything. If you have a butt, then you'll be fine. But my pancake flap jacks couldn't fill it. All good.) I love the zipper in the front so you can decide how much or how little of the ladies you wanna show off.  The shoulder pad part has a material that is thick/unforgiving, & makes it a little difficult to get over broad football player shoulders like mine. All I did was a little shimmy and it fit right over. Problem solved then fit like a glove. Other than that, it's very breathable, very comfortable, very cute, & I can't wait to wear it for my party. Like most one-piece costumes, it doesn't accommodate differences in shoulder widths, bust/waist measurements, or back side size/shapes. But the large fits me 99% well in 99% of the places, so I consider this a win. I didn't look at nor follow the size guide, so I can't comment whether it's accurate or not. I just followed all the review suggestions, my gut feeling, & my previous experiences in online shopping for Halloween costumes. Now, if I have to make a mad dash to the bathroom, this costume could prove difficult to remove in short time frame. Guess I'll just have to pay attention & give myself plenty of time.I can't find any major cons of this costume. My shoulders are big and my back side is small, so what? The costume isn't ripping nor falling apart. & it's super cute.Do yourself a favor & BUY THIS COSTUME! I absolutely love it & see myself wearing it for a few years. I hope this review made sense...

  The costume is really cute in person! However, as I was unsure about the fit I ordered a medium when I usually wear a small. I’m 5’2, 36B, with an athletic hour-glass shape. I have wide hips and a bigger derrière. The medium was perfect on top except for the sleeves being a bit long, But the waist and lower area were baggy on me and didn’t look right. The belt fit ok but the garter was WAY too big, even on my muscular legs. So I exchanged for a small. Hope this helps :)

  So I am 115 pounds and 5’4 and orders the small which fit okay but the garder belt was huge and the straps where the bust area were too large because of how small my chest is. I reordered the XS and it’s a tighter fit but everything fits a little better. I think it’s an adorable outfit. I haven’t decided if I’m going to keep it or not thou because the Ninja costume by this brand is adorable so I have to make a decision on which one I like more.

I was a little bummed the small was more money than the medium and large sizes but it was definitely worth the price with the way it looks once it is on!

  This is very cute and comfortable. The top has a surprising amount of support for women with larger chests. It’s definitely sized for curvy or hourglass women. Size large fit me and I’m a pretty heavy woman. I’m 5’7 205lbs and wear XL tops and size 14 pants. I ordered this in a size large because so many reviews said it was loose in the Butt. For my shape I could have gone with XL because the shoulders were a little small, but the large works.

  I LOVED this costume. I’m 5ft 1in and 160lbs. I typically wear either a medium or large in most clothes and am between a C and D cup. After reading the reviews I went with the medium since the material was stretchy and I’m glad I did! Fit great, little tight in the chest but I could still zip it all the way up.

  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit. I’m 5’4” and 128lbs — I bought an XS. Everything fits perfectly (albeit a bit snug.) Be aware that the silver material is pretty thin, so tights might prevent the dreaded camel. Haha! The “helmet” should be left out and worked a bit before you wear as it’s a bit creased. Otherwise, I highly recommend this costume!

  Great high quality costume! I got it for a space-themed party. It is sexy and comfortable. I am a size 6 (small on top, curvy on the bottom)- I ordered the medium and it was too baggy especially in the butt. I reordered the small and it fits much better. It’s a titch tight from shoulder to crotch, but the overall fit is way better. So if you’re a size 6-8 go with M but if you’re a 4-6, go S.

  Bought this costume for my next Disney Cruise. Tights are a little see-through, but not too bad. I will be wearing black leggings instead due to it not covering my backside the way I would like. I didn't like the frilly lace, so I cut them off. The shoulder belt thing looks like crap on me (I'm 5'5""), so I'm still debating on whether or not to wear it. It's still a cute outfit. I did have to throw the top in the dryer to get the wrinkles out, but that's only because I don't own an iron.

  The top is nice. I truly expected higher quality from this product, but it was nothing better than what can be purchased at WalMart. The pants were uncomfortable, thin, see-through and too small. The vest is too big, but it is 1x/2x and I'm on the low end of 1x. If I could have see the product first, I would have never paid this price.

  I was very happy with this costume.  Some folks at work did not recognize me in this outfit with a black wig.  I got a free sample of darker foundation from Sephora and watched a tutorial on youtube on how to look like a female pirate.  I left the belt at home and traded the pants for a heavier pair since I live in the frozen north and Halloween tends to be a bit cold.  The vest is attached to the white shirt making for a comfortable fit.  If this tickles your fancy, buy it!!

  This costume did not match the picture at all. The letters were pixelated and the neckline was different. My costume package also arrived opened and the dress was unzipped which shows that this has been previously used. The black shoulder straps were short compared to the white shirt underneath so it pulled the dress up awkwardly. Not good quality at all.

  I loved this costume. I wasn’t sure what size to get based on reviews saying it runs small. I ordered size small/medium, it fit perfectly. I’m about 140 lbs, just for reference. The dress is a little short but I wore it with fishnets and boyshorts under which helped keep the dress down and helped to make sure I didn’t show too much. The garter and arm band were too tight but I have big thighs so I’m not shocked lol I didn’t really like the gloves so I chose not to wear them. I did try on the next size up to see if it fit better. It was perfect length wise but it was huge around the waist. Overall I’d definitely recommend this costume.

  I had ordered this costume with 2 day shipping since it was less than a week before Halloween and I wanted to make sure I got it. I live in Canada, and got it in just over 2 days. The material is good, the straps are a bit loose (but there is velcrow, im assuming to cross at the back to make it tighter.) Looks exactly as pictured. I originally thought M/L would be too big, but I knew S/M would be too small. I've tried on costumes at halloween stores (of this brand and others) and have figured out that they run small. I was looking through other comments and not many mentioned the sizing. So M/L is definitely a medium and a smaller medium at that and so forth with the other sizes. I'm 5'7, 135 lbs and a 34d. It fit me pretty well on the hips and in the chest. The dress is short enough to be sexy but not short enough to be too skimpy or uncomfortable. If you're over 5'9 or 5'10 I probably wouldnt recommend this costume. THE COSTUME DOES TURN YOUR SKIN PURPLE AND ANYTHING WHITE.

I remember my fiance going into the restroom and a older guy got scared and asked what's going out there, is it safe. He told him everything is fine, it's just a costume, it was a good laugh. I wore a pair of high all black boots with the costume, everything else was included.. I also added a pair of handcuffs as an accessory. The gloves and bands worked well for me. I'm 5'6 160lbs.

  Like most female Halloween costumes, this runs on the small and short side. However it is pretty well made and is a nice stretchy fabric. It comes in your standard costume packaging.If you have long legs, you will probably have to either wear shorts underneath, or be prepared to be tugging down the dress all night. I also found the arm and leg band to fit very tightly, admittedly I have fairly muscled limbs, but it felt like the bands were cutting off circulations.For reference, I am 5'8"" 165 lbs, 41-30-41 and ordered the M-L. It did fit, but was quite short for me and she chest/shoulders were a little tight.

  I ordered two of these dresses for a costume party a few weekends ago. The shipping was fast and i was able to track the items. The package arrived 4 business days after the order was placed.The costume was great, pretty much exactly what was expected. It is a tight tube dress, it's a little short but I wore stockings underneath anyway. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that the garters depicted were made of elastic which means to keep them up they cut off circulation a little. They constantly fell off during the night so I gave up on them.Overall very pleased with this product and delivery.

  I got this costume for the past Halloween. Even thought it says SWAT on the front, it is hard to tell it is a SWAT officer without accessorizing correctly. It kind of looks like a normal dress. The armband and thighband were a little tight (I got size medium/large and am about 5 feet, 135 lbs) but wearable. The fingerless gloves were just made of a light fabric and fit pretty well. I wouldn't suggest purchasing unless you have other things ready to accompany the officer. Or if you're crafty and have the time, I think it wouldn't be hard to make this outfit yourself at home.Side note: not sure if will happen in future, I saw a lot of other people wearing same costume around!

  I wore this costume to work, so I was relieved to find it comfortable and cute.

I would definitely recommend some black shorties if you are any taller. It is machine washable! I'm not sure if he I frictions recommend machine washing or not, but I risked it and the costume still looks great.My only complaint: the straps were a little big, but I used the arm band to secure the straps together in the back and it was no longer an issue.

  This costume fit just as i expected. It is good quality. It is a 4 piece costume just as the description states. I like that it brings pretty much everything you need for the costume. All i needed to add to it were a pair of boots and fishnet stockings to complete the look. I got alot of compliments on halloween night and not to mention, my boyfriend loved the costume! I would recommend to wear a pair of boyshorts underneath though, as the dress is quite short and when you dance it slowly starts moving upwards, I am glad i was wearing boyshorts, otherwise everything would have been up in the air!

  I love this outfit! My daughter got it for her Halloween costume this year and it looks sexy and tough! Be aware that ordered in the sm/med size it is more small than medium and if you are bigger in the bust than a 34-36 D you need to order up! The costume and the accessories are all of really good quality for the price. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that one of the buckles on the front were not sewn on correctly and was hanging off on one side but it was nothing that could not be fixed in a few minutes with a little effort:)

  This was my Halloween costume. It was fun, for sure. I had to buy fishnet stockings because the outfit is really sorry and I didn't want to show that much skin.

  The costume came in a timely manner, wrapped, and brand new.  It was the correct size, and the right costume.  The picture is decieving however, because the skirt is way shorter than the picture shows.  I normally wear a size 10 in jeans, and i ordered the M-L, which seemed to only be able to fit someone who was many sizes smaller than myself.  The arm band and the leg band were also made for someone who is way smaller.  I am not fat, but Im not the girl in the picture.  Other than that, the costume was cute, added with stretch pants or pantyhose.

  I got this costume yesterday and tried it on. It was better than I thought :) It has a zipper up the left side of the skirt (I guess to help getting it on?). The buckles in the front are great and the shoulder straps Velcro in the front so, like others have said, it can be crossed in the back or straight. One of the straps even has a place where you can put 3 bullets if you have them.The arm and leg bands also Velcro closed, but they are VERY tight, and I am a relatively athletic person so I thought that this is odd. I might make my own by cutting up some black tights.The gloves are a little big, they fit my boyfriend better than they fit me.Overall I think it'll be a hit! I am pairing it with this belt (

  My son LOVES this outfit! He loves it so much that I purchased two more Melissa and Doug role play sets the following day! It was very large on my 3-year-old but the sleeves and legs have elastic ends, allowing for a secure fit around the wrists and ankles. This also fits my 7-year-old nephew perfectly! The helmet is a little too big for both of them but it was something easy for my husband to fix. I wish Halloween costumes were made this well and this reasonably priced! Oh, I almost forgot to mention my favorite part: It's machine washable!!

  My son LOVES cars and this outfit was a hit. We initially purchased for a Halloween outfit, but it has become a constant in our household, regardless of what day it is. We love the fact that is has the racing stripes and patches as shown on actual race car drivers jump suits.  The foam steering wheel is a little odd, but my son doesn't play with that item, as he would rather have a car in his hand.He is 3 and while this suit is big on him, the elastic around the ankles and wrist allows him to wear it without tripping and prevent the sleeves from falling below his hands, so he will definitely be able to grow into this outfit. Another great plus... it washed well and has not faded and/or shrunk/lost shape. Definitely would recommend!

  My son loves dressing up as a race car driver in this costume bc he wants to be a race car driver. From a parents point if view....the helmet is very cheaply made. The plastic part that is supposed to help it stay on their heads immediately fell out. We tried super glueing it but it still falls out. It is very big and does not stay on a kid’s head. The steering wheel is foam and kind of useless. My son never uses it. The outfit is nice. He loves wearing it.

  My son loves cars and wanted to be a race car driver for Halloween so we got him this. It's more durable than one of the cheap ""bag costumes"" from a Halloween store, plus he loves the helmet and steering wheel. He wears it for dressup with his friends too. He was about 38lbs. and 39"" tall when he wore this and it fit a little big but still worked. Hopefully he'll be able to wear this for years to come.

  Really good quality costume. Would be great for cooler weather, was warm for the Caribbean climate. The inner part of the helmet kept falling out so  I had to stick it with tape, but otherwise the costume was perfect. t ft my small 5 year old a little big, but he is small for his age,  I would say the suggested age range is accurate.

  FANTASTIC Costume.  My 4 year old gokart enthusiast wanted to dress up as a professional go oart racer for halloween.  he didnt vwant to take the costume off.  everyone got a kick out of it.  tge steering wheel was the icing ob the cake.  he wears a size boys 5 and it fit perfectly on him with enough room for a comfortable loose fit.  I would say the costume is close in size to a boys 6. its well made and the elastic waistband with the belt makes it super easy to stay on.  Perfect one piece zip and warm and convenient for little race car enthusiasts!

  My son found a costume like this at a children's museum.  We ordered him one for Halloween before we even left the museum.  He's a big 3 year old so it worked.  The one thing he didn't like was the microphone, but I think it was just his preference.  He's been wearing it all evening.

  Great little outfit. My four-year-old absolutely loves it and cannot wait to be a racecar driver for Halloween. Did not give 5 stars because there is no liner on the inside. The Disney race car driver costume has a thin lining through the inside of the outfit. However, that one is about $11 more. So for the price, this is a great little outfit.

  This outfit is definitely cute and the jumpsuit is well made. However, the clear screen on the helmet was scratched badly on ours.

  Not like a Halloween costume, much better material and better stitches. I purchased for a preK class and because of the elastic wrists and ankles it fits my teenest to the largest kiddos. Helmet is ok, had to take off the size adjuster to make it easier to share. I added some Moble 1 stickers and Corvette racing vinyls to dress it up. I found a racing shop to lend me a real cool steering wheel but the one it comes with is ok and a light weight foam.

  My four-year-old daughter loves to play pretend, and we're hard-pressed to find more realistic-yet-kid-friendly dress-up outfits than those from Melissa & Doug.  The four-year-old loves the bright colors and the imaginative play that springs forth when she's using the costume, and I love the quality and that these dress-up costumes provide a dress-up alternative to the Princess.  Not that there isn't a place for princesses in the World of Pretend, but sometimes a gal just has to put on her firesuit and take her Amazon Box Racecar for a spin around the track!This set comes with a racing suit, a cool helmet with a visor, and a foam racecar steering wheel.If only it came in Big People sizes, too!

  Melissa & Doug do it again!  My son adores all types of cars and loves to pretend that he is a race car driver.  This set takes his play over the top!  The outfit seems to be very sturdy and can stand up to the washing machine and come out looking great.  The patches are secure, this certainly isn't some poor quality costume.  I wish I would have ordered it sooner, it would have been a wonderful Halloween costume.  I can't say much about the steering wheel, for whatever reason it just doesn't appeal to him.  He far prefers to just drive around his little cars.  However, the next large box I get I think he would get a big kick out of sitting in it and pretending to ""drive"".  Don't hesitate to order this great set!  There is elastic at the cuffs so right now it is a little large on him but it doesn't bother him because the elastic still makes it feel like it fits.  However there is a lot of room to grow into it.

  Perfectly timed for Halloween! My nephew desperately wanted to be a race car driver. His insistence came from finding a motorcycle helmet in the garage, so we knew a helmet was a must. We were elated to be able to give this to him!He is an average sized 5 year old, and the suit fit him just perfectly. He is 43lbs and 41 inches tall. The gathered cuffs make it easily adjusted for many sizes and heights. The zippered suit is simple but easy to put on and take off.The helmet was a thick plastic, which is an upgrade from those other kits where the helmets feel so thin that you know it will break any moment.The addition of the foam steering wheel helps add to the costume. However, this is more for the role play then to carry if you trick or treat. It becomes a hinderance when carrying a bucket and going door to door. Fortunately, it is light so it will be easy for mom and dad to juggle.

  My guys love to play dress up. My four-year-old was so excited when this arrived. He tried it on and then insisted on wearing it everywhere (the grocery store, church, to pick up his big brother from school). It fit him well (He usually wears a 4T or  5T in clothing).My only real complaint is that the sizing band that goes inside the helmet continually separates from the helmet, and it was a little to difficult for my son to snap it back in on his own. Other than that, the quality seems really good. He loves that he can put it on and take it off by himself. So many of his costumes have velcro in the back, but this one has velcro in the front.This has been a great costume for imaginative play.

  The quality of this set is much higher than I expected! The plastic of the helmet is a little thicker and more durable than I expected. The steering part is foam and seems like it will hold up, but our kids' interest level in it has been low so far. We could do without that.As far as the costume goes, it fits our very tall 4 year old and our average sized 6 year old but definitely wouldn't fit our 6 year old who is the size of most 8 year olds. The quality is better than the usual dress up - this could definitely be a Halloween costume if you wanted!

  We have quite a few Melissa and Doug costumes/outfits and they are all great.  This one is a race suit (with a velcro cinch waist strap), a foam steering wheel and a helmet with a plastic visor.  Both our son and daughter wear and like this, and it fits both of them (3 and a 5 year old).The only downside is the piece that keeps the helmet tight on your head,likes to come out.  Some glue keeps this in, but somewhat annoying.  Otherwise the race suit is very well constructed, the foam wheel is quite durable (although over time they will bend and discolor, but they are very resilient -- we have quite a few of these foam accessories).

  Melissa & Doug are quality items. This race car costume is the same. The costume itself is made well and very detailed.  My son is on the shorter side, so this was a little too long for him. I also couldn't get him to keep the helmet on. It has plastic on the inside to help hold the helmet in place that doesn't seem very comfortable. The steering wheel he likes enough to play with it on its own. I have only washed this once so we'll have to see how it holds up over time.

  While deciding what type of costume to get for our 3 year old, we came across this Melissa and Doug Construction and thought it would be a great idea. Leading up to Halloween he has really enjoyed watching the Blippi Halloween song, which features that personality narrating while in a construction themed costume.This construction style costume is made fairly well and, overall, should last at least a couple of years, even with the occasional use during playtime. The reflective strips work great and are clearly visible when light reflects off of them. We were able to put the vest over his winter coat, had him wear his beanie with his hood going over the helmet, for a complete “construction worker in the winter time” look.As good as this costume is, there are some things that could be better and might turn those with really little ones off from buying this until they’re a little older. The goggles have no air, or breathing, holes, so after only a few minutes of wear they will fog up. We drilled holes into ours to prevent this from happening. The inner headband is not directly attached to the helmet and can come off without much effort. The connectors on the headband do not have very large points to keep the band from coming apart. The pockets aren't quite long enough to properly keep the tools from falling out, if the child moves quick enough, but the large pocket is able to fully hold the goggles.This Melissa and Doug costume is definitely a quick and convenient way to turn your child into a construction worker. If possible, we would’ve given this 3.8 stars.If you found this review ""Helpful"", please click the button below.

  This set fits well, with room for growth, my 43 inches tall son (4 year old).The jacket is very well made and the pretend saw, hammer and googles are nice, but the helmet has some design problem. It comes with a plastic ring that you are supposed to snap inside the helmet and should allow you to adjust the head circumference for different fittings, but it does not work.That thing neither snaps firmly into the helmet nor it stays closed in any position once you put it on. It is useless.Still, we purchased other role-play costume sets from other brands (as they had more parts) and none were well made as this.  I'd recommend.

  pretty disappointed with the helmet on this. I decided to go with Melissa & Doug brand because I bought so many different dress up costumes over the years for little ones in my family and now that I have my own little ones  I wanted good quality for them as well. I tried to look closely at co.parable brands helmets because this was the main purpose for me for my little guys as I wanted something to be quality that will hold up over the years and stay on their head without a  strap to go around their chin. We have the firefighter helmet and that band on the inside is MUCH more functional than this. Somewhat of a pain to adjust but at least it stays the way you set it!This immediately comes apart. It has 2 separate snap pieces on it and neither stay together. I had to tape them both.  And then the little plastic post pieces have to turn weirdly upward to attach to the helmet a d it stays for a few minutes but it comes right apart when its taken off of a kids head  😑 i may try to tape that together as well instead of returning it but I shouldn't have to do that.I dont ubderstand why they would slack on this set when the firefighter helmet stays together no problem and is durable.The helmet part itself is however a good, firm plactic... but again... pointless if it can't stay on their head.I had contemplated also with trying a different brand before ordering this because it offered a few more tools with it which would have been fun also.  But Knowing the typical quality of Melissa and Doug I decided on this.Ill be ordering the other brand for my other little quy now to compare the two because Im so bummed about this Helmet.

  We really like this Melissa & Doug costume. It’s well made and extremely cute. My son loved using this as his Halloween costume and both of my sons have continued using the set for their every day play.I docked one star for two reasons.1. The goggles are tiny! My 5 year old son fit perfectly in the entire outfit except the goggles barely even fit my 3 year old. They were too small to wear over his eyes.2. The hat has an inner plastic piece that’s supposed to be adjustable to size it to your child’s head size. This thing was impossible to keep connected, basically making it useless. We ended up taking it out all together and the boys just wear the hat without it, even though that means the hat is a little big for now.Overall, we are happy with this purchase and it’s something we use every day. I would recommend this to others.

  My almost 4 year old loves his construction costume. He doesn't seem to mind, but there are a few things that I think were poorly designed in comparison to the other M&D costumes we have. The pockets that hold the hammer and saw don't hold them upright and because there's no additional fabric behind them for stability, they continuously flop over and the tools fall out. Also, the inside piece for the hard hat (I'm sure there's a term for that piece) does not stay in the hat and does not stay fastened to stay on my son's head. We ended up taking that part out, and although the hat is now too big for his head without it, it's less frustrating for him to constantly have to ask for help to reattach it.

  I ordered this for my 3.5 year old to wear for Halloween.  He is very small for his age and the vest was far too big for him but he insisted on wearing it anyway! I was pleased that the vest is very well constructed and not like most costumes that fall apart easily.  The hard hat is adjustable, and the hammer and saw that came with this are well-made enough that he (AND his 1.5 year old brother) will have a lot of fun playing ""construction worker"" for quite a while.UPDATE 04/03/13:  This costume is still going strong and is a favorite of my now 5 and almost 4 year olds!  The seams are holding up and the accessories are still in good shape.  The elastic on the goggles is stretched but that from the skirmishes between the boys over it!  Well worth the money spent!UPDATE 10/30/15: Yes, we still have the costume and it's still a favorite play item for my now 8 and 6 year olds, along with their 6 year old cousin.  It's useful life will be coming to an end soon since the children are growing but the costume has, with the exception of some fading/abrading of the reflective striping (a definite plus when trick-or-treating), survived a 5-year stint of ""work"" and play.

  My 2 year old wanted to be a construction worker for Halloween. I found this costume and it seemed higher quality than others so I went for it. It was a big hit with my son! Now months after Halloween, he's still wearing it around and it's holding up pretty well. The only problem we have had is with the helmet - the inner adjusting strap keeps falling out. I'm thinking I will glue it in so we don't lose that piece. He's 2 and the vest goes down mid-thigh. I'm not sure how well this would fit a child that's 5+.

  What a delightful dress-up outfit for the construction-minded kids in your life. The outfit is durable, well-made and has enough accessories to make a little one feel and look like a real construction worker. This was a must for my grandsons after watching the video series ""The Detonators"" and all of their other construction videos. They even got to wear them when they met Jim Redyke of Dykon Explosive Demolition and he was kind enough to autograph their hardhats. Even if you're not lucky enough to go to a demolition, if your little ones like to play construction worker, buy this outfit for them! It will last and last and afford a great deal of fun!

  I needed a Halloween costume for my son who just turned 6.  I chose Melissa and Doug because I know they are usually high quality and Amazon could get it to me fast.  I wasn't wrong!  High quality material, ours came on a little plastic hanger with a plastic covering so it can be stored again.  Front close is velcro so it was easy to get on and off.  The tools were made well and had fitted loops to hold them in (the saw kept falling out while trick or treating, though, so I carried that one after a while).  Another cute addition is the name tag- you can take it out and write your child's name on it, along with adding a photo if you want, so it looks like a real ID card!  Contrary to what others say in their reviews, our hat did come with an adjustable plastic ring inside of it, so you can change the fit of the hardhat.  We took it out all together since the hat fit my son well without it.  At the age of 6, this vest fit him just perfectly.  My son is tall and slender for his age.  He might be able to wear it again next year but my guess is it might be too short.  This was a comfortable costume for Halloween and my son wore it most of the day with no issues. Paired with kids work boots, it looked adorable!

  I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to wear for community helper day. She loves construction equipment and vehicles. It is a great outfit, complete with hat and tools. She loved the badge, which you can attach a picture of your child and write their name. It was big on her, but it was fine to wear for a couple of hours.

  Very disappointed in the helmet. The internal piece that holds it on the head does not work at all. There are two points with multiple holes to adjust the size, but it won't hold. Constantly popping open. I solved that problem by sewing both sides shut with an upholstery needle. Unfortunately, when the head holder is sized smaller, it isn't big enough to fit into the four peg holes that secure it to the helmet. The helmet won't stay on by itself, way too big and shallow.  It's Halloween today and too late to find a better helmet. I'm really bummed. Tried supervising the holder in, but it's not going to hold.

It don't know if I realized it was Melissa and Doug when I bought it--I looked at SO many different things (wanted to get my nephew a whole construction themed gift so I bought orange cones and a drill for him, too) so I must not have been paying attention to the maker of this set.

  Bought this for Halloween. The costume came nicely packaged and all the tools were tied well to the costume. The material was good and the finishing was clean and well done. I would have liked some more things (maybe some fake nails and screws etc). A few tips:tip 1: Don't remove the tools when wearing the costume. They then to fall if not tied to the costume.tip 2: Don't forget to write your little one's name on the name tag.

  received this today for my 2-yr-old grandson who is obsessed with construction sites (check out the book ""goodnight, goodnight construction site"").  that particular book got him interested, and now he's in the middle of a full blown construction vehicle obsession.  I am enjoying it beyond words.  He put on his little vest - real reflective tape! just like the real thing.  there are several pockets and loops in which to place the hammer and saw that come with the outfit!  The goggles are dear, but he's a two year old, not going to happen. The only problem I found is with the helmet.  It's well made, only it just doesn't fit.  The inner band allows for adjustment, but it isn't enough.  Maybe older children have no problem with it.Today, I took him to a construction site.  We were able to stand by the fence, me holding my favorite little guy, while he was wearing his construction hat..  He watched mesmerized for an hour, and that's saying something for a 2 yr old.  The worker operating the digger got out and said, ""I like your hat"".  Well , need I say more.  Then cutest grin you've ever seen on a guy with a safety helmet, and I'm referring to both of them.

  Good quality.  Only changes i would make is 1) to make pockets longer, because the tools keep falling out.  2) Hat was sturdy, but the fastener could be improved with more tightening options.  Love the ID tag where you can put a picture of your child on there.  My son was learning about buildings and construction workers, and they had to go dressed up as a builder to school, so this worked out perfect.

  I purchased this set mainly for the hard hat.  It was very cheaply made and the adjustable band inside would not stay in the hat.  the adjustable strap could be made larger, but it was very limited on how small it could be made.  There were several tabs that snapped into holes to keep the adjustable band inside the hat.  One of these tabs was the wrong size so it did not fit all the way into the hole causing the adjustable band to come loose easily at that point.  I am afraid that this will cause the adjustable band to eventually be lost from the hat.  The pockets that were provided for the hammer and saw were too shallow, causing the saw and hammer to easily fall out of the pockets provided for them.  The safety glasses had a velcro connection at the back of the head but it would have been nice to have a sliding adjustment at the point where the elastic attached to the glasses. I would have gladly paid more for a more quality product.  I remember my daughter once telling me that Melissa and Doug toys are always well made.  I did not find that to be the case on this toy.  Frankly, I would have liked to send it back, however my 2 year old grandson would not have understood why Grandma did not let him keep his new outfit.

  My kid loves this. He wore it for Halloween. It was a little big on him (he’s only two), but it stayed on and he seemed comfortable. He used it for playtime in the days that followed. It’s not perfect - helmet interior band does not stay on, and name tag is just paper. Also, the goggles are surprisingly fragile, and the vision part can pop out and be sharp if it breaks (had to take them away after they broke).

The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old.

  I purchased this costome for my 3 year son to wear on halloween.  He absolutely loved it and had a blast wearing it.  The vest was a little big but worked out well because he had a winter jacket on over it.My only complaint is that the inside of the hat has an adjustable plastic piece that gets fitted a round the child's head and is supposed to lock/ snap in to the inside of the hat.  The plastic piece would not stay in the holes of the hat and kept coming apart and causing the hat to fall off.  I had to crazy glue the two pieces together and then the hat worked fine.

  My son loves this costume!  He used it for his Halloween costume, and he likes to wear it when he is playing like a construction worker.  He is 6 and tall for his age, but the vest and helmet still fit him.  (The safety goggles are a bit small for him, though.)  The vest looks very much like what a real construction worker would wear, and we have found that the reflective tape on it makes it useful for nighttime outings or bike rides, too.  The hard hat has adjustable plastic bands inside to make it fit more snugly for different head sizes, which is nice.  The only problems I see with it are that the adjustable bands tend to come apart from the hard hat so the little pegs have to be stuck back into it every so often, and the hammer and saw that came with it tend to fall out of the pockets easily due to the pockets not being deep enough.  However, the tools were one of the things my son liked best about this costume, and they have been fun for him anyway.

  Just bought this for my son's birthday. He is 2 and obsessed with trucks and construction workers. He loved this gift! I have other dress up outfits from Melissa & Doug and they are 100% worth every penny! Excellent quality! The vest on this outfit is probably the same it better than what the professionals wear. Oh and it is actually hi-vis as well. He's a very happy boy and I am very pleased, once again, with their products.

  We purchased this for our son for Halloween.  He was by far a hit in the neighborhood.  No one was dressed like him!  The products were made out of strong/quality materials (not flimsy at all).  He uses it for dramatic play now, and still enjoys it a lot.  He is 3 (but the size of a 5 year old) and he did find the goggles to be a bit tight.  Everything else fit great and there is room for growth.

  This was a huge hit with my 3 year old for his birthday party. He wore it all day and every time we go on a walk in the 3 months since. He's not gentle, but this vest has held up well with no tears so far. The helmet doesn't fit him well. I think the insert is poor quality, but Im happy enough with the vest that I still think this product is worth the price.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts is because the goggles are very small at the largest setting, and tight on my 3 y/o's head, which he does not like.

  This is a high quality dress up outfit. It comes with a couple of tools, goggles, construction hat, tool belt and vest. All seem to be very well made. My boys didn't seem to love it as much as I thought they would, but they are more into dressing up like superheros, so maybe it's the subject matter that isn't exciting.

  On one hand, this costume was a success in that my son enjoys it  and frequently as to put it on when he is playing with friends. On the other hand though, I find that it's super, super cheap. The tools are so light that they fall out of the pockets really easily. I had to add some weight to the hammer by filling it with washers so it would stay in his pocket for all of Halloween. The hat is also  super annoying and that it has a detachable adjuster that falls out all the time leaving my son just wearing kind of like a plastic halo around his head with the hat on the floor.  I ultimately wound up buying him another hardhat altogether because it was pretty frustrating to him. I don't think I would buy this costume again. I would just assemble a construction costume by buying each piece individually from another company.  We also have the Melissa and Doug police costume, which I would say is much better than this one l.

  I knew my three year old son would love this set because he loves tools and I have seen him playing with the jacket and hardhat at this one play zone we go to regularly.  My only complaint with the set would be the goggles.  The strap isn't adjustable and it's a bit too  big for my son's head.  Actually, the goggles are even too big for his five year old sister as well.All in all though, this is a good set.

  This is a fantastic gift for a 5 year old, especially one that enjoys playing dress-up. We purchased this for our nephew, who has recently started getting excited about dress-up. He loved that this came with lots of tools – a stethoscope, shot, mask, jacket, name-tag, and a couple of other cool doctor tools. Some of them click and do something when played with, which he loved, and the stethoscope makes a heart beat sound when it's button is depressed (and batteries are added). Because this is much more than just a costume – it has all of the fun accessories with it that look real enough to a 5 year old – it is a really exciting toy. We thought this would be something he would play with for 5 minutes, but he spent an hour with it the first night he got it, doctoring everyone willing to sit for him. He called us a few days later (with assistance, of course), and he threatened to make a house call if we didnt come to see him for our appointment right then. We heard he dressed up and continued to play doctor to all visitors who came to the house over this past weekend. Who knows how long he'll continue to play with it, but he's already gotten so much time out of it and was so excited about it from the start, that we are so happy with the gift.We should mention that he did have an accident earlier this year and had to go to the ER for a few hours to get stitched up, and it was especially exciting to him to be able to play the role of doctor, after having that stressful but stimulating experience.

  My daughter LOVES the doctor kit. The pieces all fit nicely in the jacket; which is very well made!  The heartbeat stethoscope was a huge hit, as many of the more inexpensive doctor kits we have purchased in the past, simply did not do anything.  Only complaint from my daughter was that the Doctor Mask does not fit comfortably around her ears.  The company tried to make it adjustable (which is great), but the Velcro tabs that are being used are very scratchy against the ears if it turns slightly.  Otherwise, definitely worth the price!!

  My 2 year old son loves dressing up like a doctor/nurse! This will be part of his Halloween costume this year but also a fun toy he can dress up in and use year round. My son is between 2T and 3T clothing sizes. This jacket is a little big for him but he does not seem to mind. I like that he has room to grow and will get some longevity out of it. We simply roll up the sleeves and it's fine. The tools are great, easy to clean, fun to play with. He likes to use the stethoscope which makes a heart beat type sound when you press down on the diaphragm/bell. He also like the pumper (syringe), we are all now well vaccinated and then some.

So happy with it, comes with a coat, name tag that a picture can be attached to, a stethoscope, a thermometer and a reflex tester (all toys of course) everyone at school commented on how cute it was and asked where I got it from. Not only great for play would also make a great inexpensive Halloween costumeIt very well made and the stethoscope also is battery operated and makes a ""beating heart"" sound, my daughter loves this feature!

  Wonderful. I typed my granddaughter’s name on a Christmas label and attached to the name tag. Stethoscope is wonderful, as is shot needle. Thermometer is ok. Good quality. I also bought a nurses box and filled with plastic bottles and bandages. Would have been nice if doctor’s bag were included, but found the nurses bag on amazon which works well.One year later, this has gotten much use and is still in good shape. Let’s see if it will still be nice for her brother in a couple years.

  The overall quality of the item is great. Thick fabric and plastic pockets on the lab coat. The ID badge is also very sturdy and allows you to glue a picture of your child in place.Only negative is that the surgical mask is poorly designed and will not stay on your child's face unless they have (abnormally) large ears....this resulted in tears and a tantrum from our 2yr old. It is something that could be fixed easily if you are even slightly crafty, but it's also something that should have been realized during product testing.

  The kiddo really wanted to be Doc McStuffins. It is not exactly like Doc but close enough and she loves all the gear that came with the Doc coat! The coat is heavy duty and that was perfect for our blistering cold Halloween we had. It was heavy enough and big enough to allow me to put her winter coat under the Doc coat.

  Sure wish I had seen this before buying the playschool Dr. set for my 3-4 year old grandson.  Just like their Policeman costume (AMAZING quality and accessories), the Dr. set is way above average in construction and instruments. The stethoscope even gives coughing sounds. I does not give a heartbeat but none of the play sets do and at least this one makes noise.  4 great pockets to store the  ""instruments"" in AND a mask, which Alex loves most of all. The mask has Velcro so it fits any head by hooking over the ears. There is a place to write the child's name in on a card in the front pocket and a large, realistic medical emblem on the back. Like all of their costumes, the Dr. outfit comes on a hanger with heavy plastic over it. That way, after playing, the instruments go into the 4 pockets, the stethoscope over the hanger, the lab coat on the hanger and then cover it all up to hang neatly in the closet. Sure beats having all those items all over the house!  Melissa and Doug outfits really are worth way more than the  price they charge to get all of their extras. I'm careful with my money but I really believe these costumes are the best this grandma, or anyone can buy.

  The quality was as expected from the brand. For the price, very probably the best Dr. dress up set. My daughter loves the Doc McStuffins show, so we thought it would be fun if she had her own outfit. It's been almost a year and she still plays with the toys and outfit, which by the way have not gotten damaged after normal wear and tear over that time frame. The batteries last a very long time in these toys, which is always a big plus when toy shopping.The coat fit a 4T pretty well, and probably a bit larger than that even. But even after that gets outgrown, the toys that come with the set will keep on ticking.For the price range of this toy/outfit, you just won't find anything better.

  I found this on a list for gift ideas for either a Kindergarten or five-year old girl.It's great.  My girl likes both the dress up aspect of it and the tools.One major advantage of this over other doctor toy sets is that the thermometer ""works"" without being put into mouths (or, heaven forbid, other orifices).  The child can just click a button, and a new temperature shows up every time.The stethoscope is also cool in that it makes its own noises--including coughing and heart beat sounds.  Just have two AAA batteries and a very small screwdriver ready to activate it.  Batteries and screwdriver not included!Our girl is five, and about 41 pounds, and the white coat seems just a slight bit too large for her--but it fits plenty well enough for playing.  Be sure to have a Sharpie handy to write the kid's name on the name tag.The mask seems to be the weakest part of the costume set.  It is poorly designed and doesn't stay on very well.We bought our daughter about 9 or so Christmas gifts in this price range, and this was by far her favorite!

  Love this. We picked up a couple of latex gloves at our last visit and added them to one of the pockets (these can be chocking hazard though, so, she ONLY plays with them supervised) .  She mostly plays with the jacket, syringe, stethoscope, otoscope, and those gloves, and ignores the other two things.  I do think it has helped her to be less worried about visiting the doctor.  Still freaks out of course, but, less so.  All of her babies and stuffed toys get looots of shots.  For some reason that seems to be the #1 favorite thing to do when playing doctor.

  My daughter wanted to be a doctor for Halloween so I figured this coat would be perfect for her.  It was beautiful!  Very well made and everything fits neatly in it's own pocket.  I did not even attempt to put batteries in the stethoscope since the other reviewers said it made a horrible noise and really, my 3 1/2 year old doesn't care if it makes noise or not. My only complaints are that on Amazon.com it says the age is 3-4 years and when I received it the package said 3-6 years so as you can imagine it was VERY large on my 3 1/2 year old but that just means she will be able to use it as a dress up play coat for a longer time.  My other problem is the ear buds on the stethoscope didn't even fit in her ears a little...they just fell right out!  She wore it around her neck so it worked out but they should really work on fixing that.  Other than those 2 issues, I loved this doctor coat and so did my daughter.

Now that her brother is old enough to understand the McStuffins show, he loves to wear the jacket and play doctor too!  I put her photo and name on one side of the ID card that goes in the clear plastic pocket and his on the otherside.  They love to check my pulse and give me shots!  Since both my grandson and I had ear infections last spring, he likes looking into my ears during the check up as well.

Also, I paid only $5 shipping and handling for the entire order! What a deal. I was very impressed with the quality of the outfits and the amount of extras that were included. Out of the three outfits there was only one defect (missing earpiece on stethoscope). The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old. The size of the outfits are appropriate as well. They make great Halloween costumes, too, and are so much less expensive.

  I bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas.  He asked for a doctor's kit, and specifically said he wanted the surgical mask and jacket as well.  This set seemed perfect until I received it.  The surgical mask is too small, and the sleeves on the jacket are at least an inch too short.  He can BARELY fit the jacket over a tee-shirt, and if a child wasn't stick thin like my son, he'd never get it on.  The fabric is cheap and the collar doesn't lay flat. The doctor tools aren't realistic at all (very cheap plastic), and the stethoscope was missing it's battery cover.  My son was very disappointed in this set as was I.  Don't waste your money.

  Melissa and Doug make great costumes, but I think this is their best. We have two and my kids use them a lot. We ended up with a second when I realized how favorably the doctor's tools in it compare with the doctor kit we have. It broke easily and this is holding up well. The coughing stethoscope is annoying, but you can leave batteries out. It's a great Halloween or everyday costume and has no gender indicators. It fits my 3-6 year olds and will stretch for older or younger.

  I've heard good things about Melissa & Doug but this was a bit disappointing. My 2.5 y/o nephew didn't want to wear the coat, which was actually pretty well made. He played with the thermometer, stethoscope, and the shot. He didn't want to wear the stethoscope on his ears but he liked letting others listen. The tools should have a box or kit to be stored in because they won't stay in the pockets very well. The sound on the stethoscope should come through the ears, not at the heart.

She immediately wanted to put it on and pretend to check everyone's reflexes and heartbeats, and to give everyone injections, etc.  She wanted to play with it right away.The only problem I have with it is that the stethoscope doesn't stay on when she puts it in her ears.  She has to hold it on, which makes it more difficult to actually use.  She doesn't seem to mind all that much, though, so I guess it isn't that big of a deal.

  Lots of stuff to play with here. Wondered before buying about accessories so want to let you know, as your friend, that the stethoscope does do some little things. 2 AA batteries will get you a cough noise and a heartbeat when you press the button. The little card that goes into the coat pocket is customizable so you can put your kid's picture and name on there. My daughter is 3 and she LOVES it. I have gotten several checkups, seems I am in good health and also my ears look pretty cool from what I'm told.

  My 3 year old son loves to play Dr with this set which Santa brought for Christmas.  The lab coat really seems to enhance the experience of pretend play.  We all know how much kids like to play dress up!  The only item I was a bit disappointed in was the stethoscope.  The ear pieces are very large and don't stay over his ears.  Also it requires batteries to make an artificial heart beat sound.  I would have rathered the kind with the foam where they can actually hear something (like the Fisher Price one).  But other than that (which isn't a huge detraction) this is a great toy that I would purchase again.

  Just the other day I was telling someone how Melissa & Doug products are first-rate, and now I have to eat my words.The doctor's suit is great -- my son (3 y.o.) looks so cute in it.  When he opened it on Christmas morning, he gave a big thumbs-up, and exulted, ""yes!""  Just what a parent wants to hear!  He doesn't hang it up, though, and I've noticed it's starting to get a bit wrinkled.  I can't see him ironing it....I'm disappointed with the tools, though -- they're just not up to the Melissa & Doug standard I've come to expect.  The stethoscope in particular is flimsy plastic and I'm afraid it's going to break in no time.  It didn't work with the first set of batteries (2 x AAA) I put in because the springs don't contact the negative terminal when I put the lid back on.  I needed to get a different brand of batteries where the negative terminal extends over the entire end cap of the battery.  The other tools are reasonable (the ear scope is also a bit flimsy, but better than the stethoscope).Despite my reservations, my son loves it, and has had it on a few times, and it's only the day after Christmas.

Her older siblings had to at first explain and demonstrate the different ""instruments"" which came with it but once she caught on, she had a great time the rest of evening going from person to person doing exams and giving shots.

  I purchased the doctor costume for my daughter for Christmas. It comes in a little plastic bag, (similar to what you'd get for your clothes from a dry cleaner), which is nice to keep around so you don't lose any of the accessories.You do need batteries! The kind you use for a watch in the stethoscope.On that note, you may get very tired of hearing the smoker's cough sound effect that comes out of the stethoscope. It switches back and forth between that and a heart beat. There are little plastic discs on the part of the stethoscope that would traditionally go in your ears, those are a little on the rough side and could hurt if your child stuck them in their ears, I recommend only putting it around their neck. It still can potentially scratch them, it needs to be polished or have a better quality.The thermometer is just a play one, you click it and it turns to different temperatures.The plastic on the ear checking instrument is a little on the rough side too where it may go in someone's ear.The doctor's mask has some velcro on the parts that are elastic that go around your child's ears, I'm not sure if it's my daughter having a smaller head, but this doesn't seem like it would aid too much in adjusting the size, this thing always comes off.Overall I'd say most of the plastic where it may have been cut by a machine might have some roughness to their edges. But I would still recommend it for price, alternatively you could buy a separate play doctor's kit to go with the jacket, which to me is the main selling point.

  I am very happy with the quality of the jacket - that is the main reason we bought it for my son because who can be a doctor without the doctor's coat?  :)  The ID badge that you can personalize is a nice touch.  The surgeon's mask didn't fit him well but he didn't seem to really care for it anyway.  As many others have said, I didn't care for the stethescope's sounds.  It was a little freaky but mainly, it was sooooo annoying to hear!  All the tools, in my opinion, are just teal-colored plastic.  I didn't really like them when researching it online and I feel the same way with them in my hands.  Because of this we purchased the Fisher Price doctor's kit.  Kinda sucked to have to buy 2 items for basically one gift - and the M&D set was a tad pricey IMO for just the doctor's coat.It's a cute set, though.  I will warn any parents who knows their child will want to open this ASAP - there are red threads practically sewn into the coat to hold all the various instruments (for display purposes).  These were impossble to get off!  I had to use a knife/scissors combo and it was hard to do without cutting the jacket.

  Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter. She has had little to no experience at a doctor  except vaccinations . Which is why I bought it for her ..I didn't want her to be afraid .She sees Drs. on cartoons and seemed to know what to do with the stethoscope. She was pleasantly surprised when she heard  the"" heart "" beat .We all got exams on Christmas morning and she assured us that we were ok.

  The quality of all the items is pretty good.  It has a name tag that my son asked me to label it and makes him very proud.  He has played doctor many times.  When I asked him what he will be for Halloween, he gets very proud and exited to say that he will be a doctor.  I am very happy I bought this.I was disappointed it did not have a hat or something for his head.  We have another doctor set with a bag which he likes using.  I like the idea that all instruments can fit in different pockets of the robe. The price we paid for the set is somewhat higher from what I would have like to pay.

  My 3 year old daughter loves this dress-up set!  I agree with other reviewers that the stethoscope sounds are a bit odd.  It alternates between a hacking cough and a heart beat and is quite loud.  An off-switch for the noise would be a great update if they change this.  This is also a good way to introduce kids to what to expect when they go for a check-up.

  I love Melissa and Doug toys, especially the role play sets. This one has a lot of different things that come with it that are fun for kids to use when wearing it. The coat has Velcro under the buttons so the kids can get it together or apart easily. My only complain is that everything was sewn to the coat (instruments, pockets, etc) with red thread that had to be cut to get it out. It is hard for a kiddo to wait that long when they are excited to play with it.

  nice looking costume. my 3 year old loves playing doctor, and he loves that it came with a mask and doctor tools.

  Overall this is a great toy for a great price.Here is why I think it's great:1.The outfit is made out of very durable material.2.Pockets are made of see though plastic which so when the tools are inside you can see them - a nice feature.3.Includes all the essential toys/parts to play doctor.4. Parts are made from durable plastic5. Pasrts are large enough not to be a major concern that a toddler could swallow it. Exept for ear pieces on the stetoscope.Improvements I would suggest:1. Stetoscope did not include batteries. I know I could order online but would have been nice if they were included.2. Thermometer should be more realistic - you have to press it again a surface and it clicks aka measures temperature. Seems to be fascinating to toddlers so this comment is more for adults.

  My 29 month old daughter LOVES this more than I could have imagined.  We customized the name badge provided in the pocket before wrapping it up for Christmas.  She plays with it daily.  I think the coat and mask are critical pieces that many other doctor play sets don't include. The stethoscope could be more real-life, but I think we'll just buy a real one when she's a bit older so she can really listen to our heartbeats.  For now the toy one included in this pack is fun - it requires 2 AAA or AA batteries and makes a heartbeat sound and coughing sound.  For older children - buy a real stethoscope to add on.  I highly recommend this set.  Melissa & Doug products are constantly impressing me.

  My 4 year old niece loves all things Barbie pink and princess so I wasn't sure how this gift would go over at her birthday party. Much to my surprise, upon opening the gift (and with many more waiting to be opened) she clapped with delight and immediately asked me to help her put it on. She wears a size 4T and there's room to grow. The tools are secure in their pockets and once I put a battery in that stethoscope she was checking everyone's (and all the dogs') heartbeats. I paired this gift with a children's book about going to the doctor.

My daughter loves doing role-playing with me, her little sister and her babies. It seems like what really helped her was having the doctor jacket. The rest she can use anything to manipulate Dr's.

  I don't have much to add to the other reviews, except that the ""tools"" when put into the pockets carelessly, tended to fall out easily and repeatedly. I also think the quality is not up to Melissa and Doug standards for the higher price their toys bring.Also, to grandparents out there:If you are thinking of buying this for a grandchild, please consider whether their parent(s) will take the time to be the patient ""patient"". If not, this will be put away and never used again. It's definitely a ""play with me"" toy, and not a ""play alone"" one. While most parents play with their children, not all play pretend well, and that is what is necessary - over and over and over....as well as some knowledge of what the different instruments are used for.

When she opened it, all she could say was Hurry Hurry Hurry, we could not get the security threads off the items fast enough.  this was the first birthday present she opened and she could care less about the rest of the gifts.  She went to bed with the jacket on, she did take it off long enough to put on jammies but then had to put it back on.  Everyone in the family got a physical along with the dog and I'm certain we will be getting many more.  I cannot say enough good things about this lab coat and toys.  It was the hit of the party.

  The stethoscope has a button, and when you press it it makes the sound of an 80 year old smoker coughing. It's awful. Press it again and it makes the sound of a heartbeat, but only two beats worth. Can't wait for the battery to die. My daughter doesn't like wearing the coat. I wish it came with something to keep all the tools in, we came up with something of our own. The temperature thing has a button that you click to change the temp it reads. We use a temporal reader at home, so my daughter is always pressing it on peoples foreheads, which hurts. All that said, my daughter loves the set, but there must be a better one out there. My husband ordered this, I would have kept shopping around.

  Melissa and Doug offer great quality dress up clothes.  They wash and wear better than most fabrics and come with lots of great accessories.  We have the waitress and the doctor costume sets.  My daughter loves to put her name on the name tag and that each tool has its own place.  The tools are good quality and don't break easily.  These sets truly let kids explore and use their imaginations.

  I have three daughters from 23 to 3 years of age.  My 23 is a medical student as well as her husband and my 16 is also interested in become a doctor. My three year likes to pretend to be a doctor herself.  I love Melissa and Doug products because I believe and trust they have control over production and quality.  I am so afraid of toys containing lead paint or anything else harmful.  I believe in quality and not quantity.  I always loved traditional toys and I stay away from fads. I did my research on Melissa and Doug and feel good about buying their products.  My little one loves to wear the doctor's lab coat and make sure everyone is healthy in the house.  I really didn't pay to much mind to Melissa and Doug products until my last baby was born I went back to check why I didn't purchase Melissa and Doug for my first two..only to realize the company started when my first daughter was born.  I always would buy exceptional toys from Europe now I have  exceptional toys through Melissa and Doug and Amazon

  My 3 year old was looking forward to this for a couple of days before it arrived. The night ended in more tears than anything else, both for him and us. Others have commented on the horribly inadequate hat insert. This is an understatement. Sizing the hat down is not possible, it will not stay. Although it looks like similar to a resizable ball cap with pins and holes, the pins are smooth cylinders, not t-shaped or nubed like a ball cal so they do not snap into the holes. The slightest bit of movement and the hat adjustments pop loose. Or worse the whole inset comes off. Some kids don't mind, take the insert out and the hat flops around looking cute. My son knows it's important to wear his bicycle helmet on snug, so all helmets and hats now need to be snug. Frankly this hat ruins the whole experience and not at all what we expect from a Melissa & Doug product.

  My three year old was thrilled when I told him his costume had arrived and we were both very excited to find this high quality jacket, hat, bullhorn, and extinguisher in the package.The coat is a thicker fabric with real reflective tape (a big plus since it will be his Halloween costume) that seems like it will hold up well for a while to come. The hat is also a thicker, hard plastic of good quality. The fire extinguisher is a good size and looks realistic though I wish you could squeeze the handle for the full effect. I haven't even had a chance to put batteries in the bullhorn yet but it is also a good size and seems like a quality product.He is a pretty average size three year old boy and the coat and hat both fit him well with room to grow into it without looking oversized. His only complaint is the hat is ""too heavy"" but he's used to a flimsy, plastic one he got at a party so that is relative.I don't usually write product reviews but this one really earned a shout out for being a quality product that was exactly what my son & I were hoping for!

  This is the cutest fireman costume! It looks exactly like what was in the picture. My son wore it for Halloween and it fit him perfectly. He is a 3T for reference. He continues to play with the costume. The material is good quality. The horn actually makes a firetruck sound. The hat is a little large and even with the plastic insert to adjust it, it kept coming off. I decided to secure it inside with some hot glue, but otherwise, I have no real complaints. The jacket is thick enough to wear on cooler days. I like the attachment holder for the fire extinguisher. The jacket hits my son in his thighs. There is no part of the material that seems to bother or rub him. I would recommend this outfit for anyone that has children who love firemen!

  I have purchased many Melissa and Doug items and this is the first one that seriously disappoints. As other reviews say the helmet non-adjust is ridiculous, the fire extinguisher is simply plastic with no water holding feature, and I guess my bad I did not realize the bullhorn requires batteries so not knowing that the horn was a bust too. the coat is ok but certainly not the quality of another brand I had purchased for another grandchild 6 years ago.....would have purchased that brand again but the item was shipped to a child in another state and I could not recall name.

  I have previously been happy with Melissa and Doug products, but this was a big disappointment. The costume is well-constructed and seemingly durable. Sizing seems appropriate. The accessories, however, fall far short of expectations. The bullhorn makes a sound by pushing a button. That's difficult for a 3 year old. The picture as part of packaging shows a girl speaking into it so I expected amplification. Not true. The fire extinguisher can be filled with water. All I can figure out is that the bottle needs to be squeezed to expel a water stream. That's impossible for 3 year old hands. When squeezed, it leaks since the screw on head is not a seal. The hat has adjustments for fitting. It's difficult to explain the inadequacies of the plastic insert band for adjustments, but once again a disappointment.

  Bought this for my 2.5 year old to wear as a Halloween costume and he absolutely loved it. I was happy because it was one of the few fireman costumes that didn’t come with an ax (because why does a toddler need an ax...) he is an average sized toddler and it was definitely a little big but I could easily roll up the sleeves and he was able to wear a coat under it for trick or treating.

  I purchased this for my 4 year old for Halloween. He's 43 inches tall and wears size 5/6 clothing, and it fits him perfectly with room to grow. The jacket is extremely well-made, the hat is thick plastic and doesn't bend (he tested this, by standing on it). The bullhorn is awesome and thankfully isn't very loud. The bullhorn and fire extinguisher can be velcroed to the outside of the jacket. I feel like this will last for a long time, totally worth the money and I've already purchased more outfits from this brand.

  While many people will boast of Melissa and Doug's high quality toys, I often find their products very hit or miss. In my experience a lot of their toys are great conceptually, but fall short with sloppy, chipped paint jobs and/or lack of durability.That said, this costume is a clear winner for Melissa and Doug. The fabric quality and stitching for this fire chief outfit is top notch, and the added bullhorn and extinguisher are just the icing on top. This outfit isn't like anything you'd find at Party City (where costumes fall apart after wearing them just once). It's beautiful, bright, fun and a total bargain for $25. Pottery Barn Kids sells a similar outfit for three times this amount.My 3.5 year old will probably get a year or year and a half of fun out of this before he outgrows it, but I know I'll save it for his baby brother to enjoy someday too. The fire extinguisher and bullhorn aren't as sturdy as the jacket and hat, but they're in good shape so far after countless falls on hard floor.

  This dress up set it super cute and I love that the coat is supposed to be washable (haven’t washed it yet). My kids love the megaphone that makes a siren noise too.But I absolutely hate the hat. In my pictures you can see the adjustable insert inside of the hat. It’s great in theory, but it pops out all the time. It’s literally only held in place by four tiny pegs in these little holes. It drives me nuts because it’s constantly popping out and I have to fix it.  I tried to not use the insert, and my kids have very big heads but the helmet is just way too big without the adjustable insert. I really wish it was attached better.

  Kid likes it, but helmet suspension doesn't adjust properly or fasten well with little push tabs like on back of cheap caps but less secure.  The suspension only tightens in front and back, the sides are fixed, so it gets square shaped when I tighten and it won't stay with only 2 tabs pushed in.  I can't get it small enough for 3yo, but helmet is sturdy and good kid size. Would be fine for bigger boys or maybe when my daughter is closer to 5.  The jacket is great, but even my 3yo knows how a megaphone is supposed to work, and it only plays a siren, she still likes it. The extinguisher would be much better if it had some type of hose to aim. Firefighters have hoses, so just a 9 inch piece of rubber tube would have made this magical for her, so I'm going to modify it.

  I’m really disappointed in the quality of this. The jacket is fine, but the other pieces are lacking in quality. The band that goes in the hat to size it is not built in and won’t stay in. It keeps popping out and frustrating my little boy. The other problem is the megaphone. It has a place for batteries, but we can’t even get it open despite having the appropriate size screwdriver. This in particular doesn’t make me too sad since I wasn’t expecting it to make noise, but it would be nice to have the option if we wanted to use it like that.

  This was a fantastic Halloween costume and addition to our dress up collection. The included accessories make it all the more fun. Beware, the helmet is a solid/heavy plastic and will fall off your kid’s head if they are running around with it on. I fixed this by glueing the inner head piece to the helmet (because it kept coming apart) and I also added a strap (wide red ribbon and Velcro) to go under the chin to keep the helmet on.

  My 4 year old firefighter loves it! The name tag adds a special touch with room also for a small ID photo. I expected it to be paper but it's plastic like a credit card. The horn takes 2 triple A batteries and the sound is realistic like a fire siren but surprisingly not terribly loud. The extinguisher is light weight and has no sounds or anything which is fine. The jacket closes with velcro. It is light weight but not cheap feeling at all. The reflective material is functional and realistic. I do wish it was a little bigger, sleeves longer, as it now fits my 4 year old perfectly but my son is taller and comparison in size to a 5 or 6 year old. It's going to make a great Halloween costume paired with the firefighter rain boots I bought on Amazon and black pants.

  Very nice play outfit with several included items, made well EXCEPT for the siren although annoying as its loud once its dropped Yes by a 4yr old boy the batteries 2 AA not included make for the connections to break loose, although being handy I was able to just bend the springs back into a more secure place this should be incorporated into the product knowing kids will drop these while playing. Also the siren is heavy with the batteries so having it on the belt/outfit does not work well and comes loose when running around. I still give this a solid 3 stars though as its not just a cheap costume that is bought at a box store at halloween time its color and features are great for real time play

  I love this product. I saw boxes of these at my warehouse job and just had to buy one for my little brother. He is three and he's big for a three-year-old and this fits him good and it will probably fit him good for another year. The only problem I had with it was that it comes with a fire extinguisher and the lid comes off. We had to super glue it shut because he kept putting things inside of it like dirt and bringing it back in the house. The lid is not the squirting kind either so I can't imagine why they did this but overall I love this product very high quality very durable.

  My son LOVES this costume. He is average height and weight for a 3 year old. The jacket could fit a 5 year old, but I like that he has room to grow into it while still fitting him enough to play in it now. The accessories are durable and realistic and the jacket is excellent, heavy-duty quality. The reflector stripes actually do reflect, too, which is a fun component. The hat, which can take a real beating and still come out without a crack, sometimes falls off, but there is an adjustable part inside that helps once you get the right fit. My only issues is the velcro holders for the megaphone and fire extinguisher. The holder is two straps that velcro together, but it is very challenging for my son to maneuver the velcro and position the toys simultaneously to hang them there on his own. Overall, though, my son is VERY happy with his firefighter costume. It is absolutely worth spending a little more on this specific firefighter costume for the quality.

  I bought two of these for my 3 year old twin boys for Halloween, and then as dress-ups for thereafter.  My boys small for their age, and it's definitely big on them.  We had to roll up the sleeves on the jacket.  Otherwise, it's great!I am impressed that the helmet is a very firm plastic, unlike the cheap ones kids get from fire station tours.  It's adjustable too.  The bullhorn seems like its handle will crack apart pretty easily if dropped on a hard surface.  It accepts batteries that will supposedly cause it to make various fire-related noises.  We're waiting until Halloween night to put in the batteries though -- if we put them in at all.  The fire extinguisher's ""nozzle"" actually unscrews to reveal a hollow bottle, so kids can fill it with water if desired.UPDATE November 7, 2013:We put batteries in the bullhorns for Halloween.  They make one sound: a fire engine siren.  For some reason, I had expected several sounds.  The noise is not really as annoying as I anticipated.  It's not deafeningly loud.  The button to make the noise is in an awkward spot (even for adult hands) and our boys did not reach up to press it very often.  This saved us a headache, I suppose.I noticed one of my kids stepped on an extinguisher.  It flattened until I came and popped it back into shape - just like any plastic water bottle.The product description mentions that the child's name can be penciled on the name tag.  I used a Sharpie, which worked great.  The name tag is semi-gloss paperboard.

  The coat and accessories are very nice quality and my son loves it but I do wish that the accessories were able to attach in a simpler way that my son could do himself. As it is now, you have to wrap the 2 velcro pieces around the bullhorn and extinguisher which is difficult to do when also holding the item. My son runs to me every few seconds to reattach because of course the fun is in being able to wear these at your waist and then grab off to use. A simple hook and loop would have been much easier. Also the adjustable piece inside of the hat does not stay attached and without it the hat is very large and does not stay on head very well. A few small tweaks and this could be an even better product

  I love the consistency in Melissa and Doug toys. Its hard to buy things online but when I see a company like this I just know that I will be happy with the product and they did not let me down this time.I bought this as a halloween costume for my son (who is three), which he wore this year and loved. But it also is now in his toy bin and when he is feeling heroic he will put it on.The things that I love about it:-although a tad big it fits my son fine at the age of three, but also can be worn for the next few years.-the helmet is adjustable on the inside to fit a ranges of head sizes- The personalized name tag is a cute addition and very fun and unique-it comes exactly as it looks like and the quality is great and sturdy- reflective tape made halloween fun and safe which was a really awesome feature to have-the mega horn makes noise and comes with batteries.Things I would change:- the megaphone and the fire extinguisher were a bit heavy on the velcro belt hooks and dangle, it made it impossible for my son to comfortably walk around with them all night and so they were abandoned before we left for the night-the fire extinguisher is non functional what so ever and is just plasticthis will be easy for me to resell in a heart beat and I am fine with the price with what I got.

  I was extremely happy with this product.  I bought it because my daughter wanted to be a fire fighter for Halloween, but all of the normal Halloween costumes had reviews that the material was thin... I figured they were just more like one-time-use items.  This had other good reviews about quality, and I was not disappointed.  It is made better since it is for year round dress up, not just one night.  Plus it is made well because Melissa & Doug is a good brand.The hat is made of hard plastic (not the really thin plastic kind you get at a dollar store) and it is sizable, which is great for my small daughter.  The jacket is thick and has real reflective material on it.  The bullhorn requires a couple of batteries (not included) and makes noise (it does not amplify the voice though).  The fire extinguisher is a nice size.  The cap is removable, so my daughter wanted to put water in it and use it like a squirt bottle, but it doesn't do that, which is probably for the best :).  It has a cute little badge and a place to write the child's name, which is fun.The size is good.  My daughter is 4 and very small for her age, and she does ""swim"" in this, but it doesn't look extremely big on her.  She will play with it after Halloween as a dress up outfit for a long time!

The stitching and durability of this item are spot on. We have had the item for 3 months and it has been played with many times at home and shared in the daycare and it is showing no signs of wear and tear as of yet. Many hours of pretend play for the pre-k kids. There are so many things children learn through pretend play. This product is well worth the money. The children who have been playing with it are between the ages of 2 and 6 so it fits a wide range of sizes. The toys are made of hard durable plastic and the outfit is a durable fabric with great stitching.

  Got this for my grandson for his birthday and it was his absolute favorite gift of all.  I was almost a bit embarrassed at his party because once he opened this he didn’t want to play with anything else.  He’s three years old and the jacket fits perfectly.

  We got the fireman set last year for Halloween for my older son (and the younger one went as a fire dog. It was really cute!), and we have used it again and again. They found a piece of plastic tubing in our shed a while back and that has become the hose. When kids come over to play, they go for the fireman outfit and the M&D construction vest and set again and again.  These costumes are totally worth the price, especially when they're on sale, because they hold up to rough play and the pulling on and off of little hands.  We bought the Knight costume this year for my older son, and I expect we'll have great fun with it long after the boom and bust of Halloween.  With all that said, the bull horn does break very easily as other reviewers have noted, and it did for us, too.  My boys still play with it and with the whole set, and honestly, I would rather they make their own pretend noises than listen to the battery operated ones, so I would say that maybe the broken bullhorn ends up being a win-win.

  Bought this for my son for Halloween 2012. He was 3yrs old and 35 inches tall at the time. It coat is well made, it's waterproof and is roomy enough to wear layers of clothes underneath. The sleeves were a little long for him at the time. The hat was cute but the plastic inside kept popping out of the holes. The plastic badge was a little fragile and cracked after about a week. The ID card is cute and fits into the front pocket. The bullhorn is one of his favorite things... it has sounds that are not too loud. My only suggestion would be to add velcro on the fire extinguisher and bullhorn so they stick to the coat. There are rings on the coat to hang them on, but they fall off easily.  We hung a flashlight on one of the rings instead. Now my son is 4 yrs old, 40 inches and 34 lbs and the suit fits perfectly. He wore it with fireman boots from Target and got lots of compliments. He plans to wear it again this Halloween. Overall a good buy and worth the price!

  I ordered this costume for my son to wear to his community helper day at school. This is a very good quality jacket and accessories. The reason I gave it a 4 is because the piece in the helmet that helps it stay in place on the child’s head would not stay in place itself. You could not tighten it easily. It worked fine. He just simply had to hold the hat on if he ran or moved around a lot. Other than that I am happy with the product.

  We got this as a Halloween costume. It’s now four months later and the costume is played with all the time. My son can be rough on toys, and these items have held up well.

  This costume is high quality!  It's a nice material, it looks sharp, and the accessories are NOT flimsy.  It's sturdy and has held up to many play sessions between my two children in which they pretend to be rescue workers.  The megaphone is their favorite and sometimes gets lost, but, if I can remember, it's easy to velcro right to the costume.The color is just as shown in the picture, a bright red, with great details.  The helmet fits both my daughter and son with some few adjustments!  I loved the easy velcro fastening of the jacket too since that means my daughter can mostly figure it out on her own.

  My 3 1/2 year old says this has been his favorite Christmas present!!! (and he got more than any child needs)  He wears it just about all day every day.

  We only got this yesterday, but it is already a huge hit with my almost 3-year-old son. He had to put it on immediately when I got home from work. Getting him out of it at bedtime was a negotiation, it spent the night on the shelf behind his bed, and he put it on as soon as he got up in the morning. His face just beamed when I told him that the hat made him look like Fireman Sam. He spent the evening running around spotting smoke and putting out fires. :)A couple of notes... I was glad that I read previous reviews so that I was prepared for the full impact of how annoying the bullhorn is. A piece of clear packing tape over the speaker turns it into a bearable toy. Also, other reviewers were correct about the inside of the hat falling out. I used some heavy duty household glue on that, which will hopefully solve that problem.

It has a little hole at the nozzle that water can come out of it.If it is intended to be a water bottle, it leaks around rim of the bottle.  I think the props for the costume can be improved.

  Product was packaged in a box rather than the bag as shown. Makes it easier for wrapping as a gift. The jacket is a thicker material, I was nervous it would be plastic.

  I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who is crazy about all things ""fireman"" ever since a ""Real"" fireman came for a talk at his school.  I wanted to get him a good quality firemans outfit, not cheap plastic, and the Melissa & Doug Fire Chief Role Play Costume Set came with a polyester/nylon coat that is heavyweight and actually can be worn as a jacket.  It is washable by hand or machine washable on delicates and cold.  The Bullhorn actually works with two AA alkaline batteries (he pushes the button on it and it makes a siren sound.  Unfortunately it does NOT actually function as a working bullhorn, which would have been MUCH better) and the ""fire extinguisher"" is not flimsy, neither is the plastic hat.  My grandson was so crazy about the outfit that he slept in the coat for several nights straight.  A REAL hit!The Fire Extinguisher and Bullhorn attach to the coat on the velcro waist strap.

  My 4 year old loves his fire outfit!Melissa & Doug toys solve problems that other similar toys have.One example is the fitting straps on the inside of the helmet. These plastic straps always break, and the kids wear the helmet anyway. On other products – if the straps get ripped out of the helmet there are sharp plastic edges left behind that can cut. On the Melissa & Doug fire helmet, the fitting straps on the inside are actually removable and there are no sharp edges at all.Another example is that it’s all washable.Melissa & Doug toys are going to last longer than other similar products.

  We have really enjoyed the Melissa & Doug products that we have bought over the years. However, this costume set could use some modifications. We bought two sets, one for our four year old and another for our two year old. Within one month one of the megaphones stopped working (we tried changing the batteries). They are a cheap plastic and I'm sure that it broke from being dropped, but this should be adjusted for in the design since it is made for children. And, the straps that hold the fire extinguisher and megaphone on the jacket are shredding because they get caught on the velcro closures. The most durable part of the whole set is the fire hat. It is a good heavy plastic and it is withstanding daily repeated use.

  Ordered it for my 3 yr old for Halloween 2010. He's of average height and weight so this fit perfectly. Unless there's a growth spurt, seems like he'll get to use it for another 1-2 years. It's a well made product, as good as the real thing and way better than the cheap vinyl outfits you see in discount stores. The yellow reflective tape shines bright. I especially like the helmet since it is very sturdy (a kid could stand on it without denting it) and has straps inside that snap together to fit around the head so air can get under there and they don't sweat. The bullhorn and extinguisher attach to the jacket with velcro wraps. It's useless tying it on since they make the outfit bulky. Haven't put batteries in the bullhorn, just to save our sanity!

My only complaint about the fire chief costume is that there aren't pockets for the accessories. Instead, there are two pieces of velcro that come together to hold those items but a 3 yo doesn't yet have the fine motor skills for that, so he wants me to fix it constantly. The police uniform has pockets so doesn't have this issue. Plus, the police uniform has been more of a hit among every kid that has played here recently.

  My two year old is obsessed with all things Fireman, and once again, Melissa and Doug does not disappoint.  With a well-constructed fireman jacket, hat, and accessories, my little man can't get enough.  Only criticism is the hat: entirely too large to fit the rest of the outfit.  The hat is for a larger child, while the coat is definitely geared up to age 5 or 6.  As with all of M&Ds products, it is well made, sturdy, and provides hours of dress-up entertainment!

  I bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 year old (who is about the size of an average 5 year old).  I was impressed by the quality of materials in the jacket.  My son has really enjoyed playing with this kit.I deducted one star due to the cheapness of the inside fitting for the fire helmet.  The sizer doesn't stay snapped leading to it becoming loose and falling off often. Other than that, it's a great product.

  Great quality costume! So many of times, kids costumes are poorly constructed and don't last a week with my rough and tumble boys without getting holes or breaking accessories. Almost 2 months later with use almost daily, and this is still in perfect condition. Fits my slightly small for his age 3 year old and is a little big (which is perfect so he has room to grow) as well as my tall, long-armed 5 year old (won't fit him for much longer though...the arms are a slightly short). My only complaint is that it is not made in the US.

  My 4 year old granddaughter wants to be a firefighter when she grows up. I bought her this costume for her birthday. She was so excited! She wore it the day she got it, then the next day while we were running errands around town too. I started calling her ""Chief"" and she loved it! The quality of the jacket is amazing. The yellow stripes are very bright, and the gray stripes are light reflecting. The helmet is heavy duty plastic. The bullhorn and fire extinguisher are so cute hanging right there on the jacket.

  I own 4 Melissa and Doug outfits, i have 3 fireman suits and 1 police. My son loves to dress up and wears these suits daily. Within a couple months the stripes started unraveling and coming off.

I would not recommend this coat for purchase if you are wanting something that will last a long time.

  Great quality with real reflective stripes on the jacket.  Jacket is easy for my son, who is five, to open and close himself (velcro).  Helmet is adjustable.  Megaphone has a siren that makes an irritating and loud cry, but that's what they're supposed to do, right?  Extinguisher does not shoot water, just a fun prop.  Siren and extinguisher can be secured by velcro straps on the front/waist of the coat.  My son did have some trouble securing the extinguisher and siren on his own.  Overall, less expensive and better quality than the Infinity brand sold at Toys R Us, which has impossible buckles down the front of the jacket.

  Very happy with the purchase! As many other reviews stated, the quality of the fabric and hard plastic hat are top notch and durable. Definitely believe it to be sufficient to hold up to washing. Also my son loves the battery operated siren! My only complaint is regarding the name badge pocket. The red dye of the suit appears to have dyed the plastic as well so when the included name badge sits all the way at the bottom of the pocket, you see red streaks all over his name and picture. Will not be sending back as he will need it for Halloween this year and hopefully no one notices the red badge!

  Very soft & good quality fabric, the hat is adjustable which is great. The extinguisher is able to be filled with water but does NOT spray which is okay (dont need a toodle with something that is more or less a spraygun inside).

  My husband and I were both impressed with the quality of this suit.  I bought it for halloween, but had asked a friend who bought it what the quality was, and she said excellent.  It isn't plasticy, it's durable and comfortable.  I haven't put batteries in the bull horn yet, but my son hasn't noticed.  The badge does come off fairly easily, I'm thinking about stitching it on so it stays on better.  The piece inside the hat that sizes it fell out, but he likes wearing it regardless and it's easy to snap back in.  I have a feeling this will be played with for a couple years.

  The hat is hard to get a good fit. It appears to be adjustable, but it's not very adjustable so it kind of swims on my kid's head. I like that it says FIRE CHIEF on the back, very cool.

  This is a great quality costume/dress up outfit.  The coat is durable and well made and the accessories are fun too.  Amazon had the best price by far when searching for this item.  My four year old will be wearing it as a Halloween costume and then keeping it to use for dress up.  Far better than items sold strictly for Halloween use and at about the same price point.  Fits true to size I would say 3-6 years ideally.My only issue is the plastic adjustable insert in the helmet falls out very easily, added some hot glue and it works perfectly.

  My son has been living in this since I gave it to him.  We've had to wash it several times and it is holding up great so far.  The reflective strips did come off, but it did not leave any marks where they were, so it almost looks like they were never there.  The hat is a really solid piece of plastic, not like the flimsy hats they give away for free at firehouses.  I bought a second set for when he wears out this set since he loves it so much and it is such a great price.

  My son loves this outfit! The jacket is good quality, which is great because it will clearly get a lot of wear. The hat and bullhorn are also a hit, the horn makes a fire truck sound. I'm giving it 4-stars instead of 5 because of the fire extinguisher -- you can put water in it, but you can't really squirt it out. The water DRIPS out, which is kind of a buzz kill, when you're rushing to put out the fire, and then the water drips out of the fire extinguisher. Other than that, this purchase is a hit.

  My kid is in his ""I wanna be a fireman"" stage, so this came perfect for him. The jacket is nice, well done and firm, and the accessories (helmet, fire extinguisher, megaphone and badge) also sturdy enought to withstand kids playing.The megaphone uses two AA batteries, not included, and when you put them on and press the button it justs plays a siren sound, at a very reasonable (low) volume. It's funny that I was disappointed by that, expecting a real mic amplifier in it (which I'm now thankful that it doesn't have one), but my kid just go with it, running and playing as he is in the fireman truck.

  My 6 year old son has a lot of fun in this costume! The color is a fabulous red with reflective stripes on the jacket that really shine! The FIRE CHIEF logo on the back is nicely printed in a large , white color. The hat, horn, fire extinguisher, photo ID, and the silver badge really add to his imagination during pretend play. The horn takes 2 AA batteries and makes a realistic siren sound at the push of a button. The extinguisher can be filled with water, but can not spray it-- only pour/drip when turning it upside down.

It is made of a canvas type material so it feels nice and strong, and there stripes are real reflectors so it would make a great Halloween costume.My son has been where this jacket almost non stop since his birthday but I made him take it off for church. He also loves the toys that it comes with and he really likes carrying them around in the loops. The bullhorn makes a siren sound which is a little annoying, but he uses that and pretends he has to run to the fire and put it out.His six year old brother even likes it and he doesn't normally like dress up; I think I need to buy the police officer one now so they each have one. Both the costume and hat fit both boys. The only thing I do not like, is the hat, the adjustable strap on the inside keeps popping out so I keep having to fix it, and my son has a little trouble getting his tools back on the loops, but this was definitely a big hit, and I am so glad I got it.

  Love everything about this except for the hat.  The inner plastic piece inside the hat (that you use to adjust the size) will not stay attached.  If you want to make it fit a smaller head, it just won't stay attached for more than 2 minutes.  The hat constantly falls off of his head.  The hat itself is very nice (hard plastic).

  My 3 year old is in love.  The only thing I would change would to make the fire extinguisher and siren straps more toddler friendly. I have to replace them every time he takes them out of the velcro straps, kinda annoying.  I'm not sure the solution, but if that gets fixed (or take the straps off altogether) that would work great.

  My 2 and 4 year old boys LOVE this costume. I like that the helmet is adjustable so I can size it to actually fit, and stay on their heads. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because I bought 2 sets of this costume, one for each boy, and the sticker on one of the helmets looked like it had been peeled off and ripped a bit, then pushed back down. It's not a cheap costume so I would have expected the main sticker on the helmet not to be ripped and placed correctly. Since I had purchased these for Christmas I didn't have time to send back to replace with a new one, or I would have. I would still recommend this for sure as the sticker was probably just a fluke.

  Purchased to go with fireman scooter lights and siren. Big hit!!!!!!!!!!!!! the bull horn was a big hit too. The only suggestion is the helmet was a bit small. The child is 5. So maybe he is a the limit of he costume, but the rest fit him fine with room to spare. He didnt take it off for 3 days. I am glad it is washable. So is his mother.

  Melissa and Doug makes high-quality and affordable costumes for preschoolers (~2.5 to 6 years).  This particular costume has been a favorite with my boys and their cousins too.  The jacket is easy to put on.  The hat is adjustable.  The siren actually sounds (it's annoying but the kids love it).  If you pair it with dark pants you have a Halloween costume.  We also used it for everyday dress-up.

  My little one loves this suit. This suit is very durable and really holds up to the rough play of my little one. This only critique I have about this suit is that the inside of the helmet was uncomfortable for my little one's head. So he eventually ripped it out and just used the firefighter hat without it. I used this in my homeschool as a teaching tool to teach about being brave and how to be helpful. We eventually went on to buy the knight and the doctor suit by Melissa and Doug too. Great products.

  Jacket is a good quality material and the hat is sturdy with an adjustable band that sometimes falls out.  Fits our 4 year old well.  The Bull horn just plays a siren noise (we were hoping for a megaphone effect - not a big deal).  The fire extinguisher sprays water as a squeeze bottle, but the nozzle was poorly constructed and sprays everywhere when sprayed.  The sticker on the fire extinguisher was also very cheap and came off the first time it was exposed to water.

  For the most part, I love Melissa and Doug products. My 3.5 year old grandson is into dress up these days, so he chose this Fire Chief costume. Everything is great except for one little detail that I have no idea how to fix! The bullhorn and the fire extinguisher are affixed to the coat with velcro straps, and the bullhorn sort of hooks onto the strap ok, but the fire extinguisher is VERY hard to wrap the strap around, I think because the strap is the exact circumference of the toy. Otherwise, my grandson loves this, especially the shiny badge that comes with it.

  We bought this super last minute for Halloween for our 16 month old. My son normally wears a 2T and the jacket fit well, just a little big in the arms. I’d day the sizing is probably a 3T. It was a huge hit and everyone loved the little fire chief! He got so much attention! By the way, what makes a big difference for this costume versus others is the quality/machine washable for dress up, and that it comes with 2 toys- a squirt bottle and bullhorn. The toys are quality, not just flimsy plastic. Love Melissa and Doug products!

  I was very pleased when I got the Fire Chief Costume Set.  The jacket is better quality than expected as it is more fabric than plastic.  My 2 1/2 year old son wore it for Halloween and while it was too big, he thought it was great, and it will last him for several more years.  The hat was also much more durable than the flimsy plastic ones he had in the past.  My only real complaint is that the bull horn makes noise when a switch is turned on and the noise is constant until he turns the switch off.  It would have been much better if he had to hold down a button to make the noise.

  I bought this for my son for a halloween costume. I was worried that it would not fit him because he is a small 3 year old (36"" and 28 lbs)and i could not find any sizing in the description. I was impressed with the costume and the quality. I had to roll up the sleeves a little bit (which did not look akward or bulky) and the jacket is slightly long, but he looks too darling in it and we got a lot of complements. the bonus was the little toys that come with it...they just attach to the jacket, so he did not have to carry it in hand while carrying his bag of candy. I did not put batteries in the megaphone thing because i read in the reviews that it was annoying, so i did not EVEN show that to my son...he just pretended to shout in it. it's worth the $$--he always wants to play with all that stuff on. the hat is adjustable, which is a plus since I can never find hats that fit his large cranium. good buy.

  Nicely made, fun to play with. Bought it for a 3 year old. The speaker and the extinguisher are held in place by velcro straps which an adult has to strap back on each time they are taken off. Could have been a better attachment method so a child could just slide them in and out themselves. My 3 year old is tall for his age. He won't fit into this in 6 months.  Already sleeves are too short and coat fits snugly. Otherwise he loves it.

Kid contains a ""Fire Chief"" jacket with silver colored badge, hat, fire extinguisher, and bullhoard. The jacket also has an ID badge which you can personalize. The outfit is trimmed in reflective tape, making it realistic and highly detailed.Cannot say enough-- for the price, this is just perfect!

  I ordered this costume who is in love with firetrucks and fireman. He was ecstatic. He wears a size 4T and this fit him great. I personalized the name tag by pasting a picture of him on it and using sticker letters to spell out his name. His favorite part is the fire extinguisher and megaphone. This is a great quality costume. It can handle Halloween night plus many more dress up years to come.

  I wish that one washing wouldn't make the seams pull away from the reflector strips. Make sure you always put the velcro closures together when washing, and/or use a laundry bag so it doesn't pull at the strings on the rest of the jacket or other laundry. Our little fireman loves this jacket, especially because it says Fire Chief on the back and is red.

  I bought these to be our twin 2 yo's Halloween costumes, and they love them! The coats are made out fabric and seem very durable, and the boys really loved having their own badges.  The only caveat is that the screws were stripped on both of the megaphones, making it impossible to put in the batteries. I personally didn't have a problem with not having two more noise makers in our house, but I thought I should mention it in a review. The attention to detail is remarkable. They even designed the hat so that it has an adjustable strap built in to help keep it on small noggins.They are so durable that the boys will be able to play with them long after Halloween (unlike the other costumes we looked at) and I plan on buying more Melissa & Doug dress up costumes for Christmas presents!

This is a great price for it, and my son LOVES putting it on and wearing it around the house.

  We have a Fireman outfit that my Grandson plays with all the time. Purchased this Police outfit and the first thing he wanted to do was put Grandpa and me in handcuffs. Unfortunately the handcuffs aren't big enough for adult wrists. After he realized how hard it is to try to get the handcuffs to close, he lost interest quickly. He is only 4 so hopefully he will become more interested as he gets older. He did like the whistle for a short while. The walkie talkie makes sound but no one can understand what it says.

  My son loves pretending to be a police officer and ticket or arrest people. He doesn't like to wear full costumes. So this was good for him, its just a jacket and a hat basically. He loves it and wants to wear it all the time. He doesn't use the walkie talkie much though. Its kind of cheap honestly, can barely hear the little sound that it does make. But we have our own walkie talkie set, so no biggie. Everything else is great. He actually likes the plastic handcuffs better than the metal ones we also have. Will be purchasing more of M&D costumes for our pretend play. :-)

  I got this for my 4years old son for his Halloween dress up. He loves to play pretend and wish to be a police officer. This costume is very nice material and come with a lot of accessories. I always love this brand because of their quality material costume. It runs a little big for my boy, but I guess he can wear it again next year. One minor thing is I wish they have a place to put the handcuffs and the whistle rather than having the boy to hold it.

  Not only does my son LOVE dressing up and playing police officer, but this costume is made out of regular fabric (not that stretchy, flimsy fabric you see in most Halloween costumes.)  The result of which is that you can just toss the jacket in the washing machine, hang it to dry, and get it clean- a HUGE plus in a toddler costume!  Highly recommended.

  I'm a grandma who purchased this set for my 3 3/4 year old grandson who is big into being a policeman and ""arresting"" whoever he can. This is one of the best designed and constructed costumes I have ever seen. Pockets in the front allow the child to carry the radio (sounds like a real police radio w/static!), whistle, handcuffs, etc. The hat has a badge that can be worn on the hat or attached to the chest pocket. There is even an identification card that can be completed and a photo attached. Also comes with a ""ticket"" which I made copies of so he could hand these out.Alex is big for his age and I would guess that the costume is a size 5.  Perfect for him now to wear over a shirt or sweater. under. He can easily wear it into next year. This costume is way more than expected for the price. So good, in fact, that I'm going to order the physician costume for Alex!

  I gave this 5 stars because my nephew LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (And I loved the price!!!)  I originally purchased it because my sister said he likes pretending he has a walkie talkie and talking like a cop every so often after he gets home from Pre-K. My nephew is in the phase of loving everything little boys usually love..monster trucks, muscle car toys, Nintendo D.S., all of which he got for Christmas.  With that being said, we purposely had this as one of his last gifts to open knowing he would be overwhelmed (he's 4) and preoccupied by other gifts he received though out the day.  I can't even explain how EXCITED he was when he saw it.  He had to put it RIGHT ON and he wore it the rest of the evening, even wore it for the car ride home :)  Great gift and great memories.

He is tall but thin so will wear it for a couple of years, it has held up nicely since he wears it daily, I've had to sew the pocket once, but I think that's because we bought him real handcuff and they are heavier than the plastic ones( he kept breaking the toy handcuff) we also made copies of the ticket so he can write tickets everyday, he's really into being a policeman, so much so that he looks like he missing something if he doesn't wear the hat.

  I wanted to buy my 3 yr old who loves to dress up something other than tutu's and princess dresses so I went with this policeman costume.  I know others have complained about the buttons falling off and I do expect that will happen with time however my experience with costumes and dress up clothes is that they're often made cheaply and flimsy which I do not find this one.  The jacket material is thicker than any other dress up clothes that I have seen.  I think the quality is wonderful when comparing it to other dress up clothes.  I also think it'll help teach my daughter that girls can be more than just pretty princesses.  She'll love it.  I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday.

  My son absolutely LOVES to dress up, and this police costume is one of the many Melissa and Doug outfits that he owns. I love the quality-- so much better than the junky fabric used in most Halloween costumes, and I am sure that it will hold up for much play and through many washings.  My only real complaint is the police radio/walkie-talkie. It is SO LOUD. There does not seem to be any way to adjust the volume. My son finds it unpleasant and so do his parents and probably even the people in the apartment below ours. The radio should come with the ability to turn down the volume, or should simply play at a lower decibel level.

  1st, I have to say that amazon had the best price I found. Melissa and Doug can get a little pricey because of where it is sold so I was so happy to save the extra $6-$8. 2nd, I was a little worries about the sizing after reading some reviews, but it was perfect for us! My son just turned 4 and wearing a regular 4 size clothing and this is just a little big on him. So there is room to grow and get that much more for my money! 3rd, all the pieces that come with it really make it a great deal! The radio is the favorite for my son, only needs a 9 volt battery. But it sounds fun and realistic with the little effects it makes. Next we'll be ordering the Fireman set!

  My son loves this police officer costume set.  He's 4, and his father is training to become a police officer.  This role play set allows him to mimic his dad, which he of course loves to do.  My only warning is to be careful of the whistle - it falls out of the elastic band meant to hold it very easily.  I'd suggest putting it in one of the clear pockets, or else tying a string to it so it doesn't get lost (as ours did, in the middle of Best Buy.  Good thing we found it!).  The walkie talkie does make sounds, but it's one repetitive clip that can get old very fast - so it wouldn't hurt to keep the batteries out if that sort of thing bugs you.  Overall a great set that my son wants to wear everywhere!This set fits my son perfectly - at 4, he's about 44"" tall and 45 lbs.

  This is almost too cute for words! I bought this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift when she requested ""bad guy stuff"". After a lot of questioning we figured out she wanted to handcuff and ticket bad guys and I began to look for a police officer outfit. She is 48"" tall and wears a size 7/8. She is really slim but this entire outfit is such a good fit on her and she still has another year or two she will be able to wear it. It is not so big it looks sloppy and the blue is so bright and beautiful. The hat fits her really good and she has a big head. I like that it is gender neutral because she has a 4 year old brother that might like to play with it someday. She carries her own dry erase marker with her ticket so she can mark and erase the offense. She really loves the whistle and laughs like crazy when she handcuffs her big sisters. I also like that it did not come with a gun. If you want your child to have one with their costume that could be a separate purchase but since we try to teach gun safety I like not having one she can play with and maybe become a little too accustomed to seeing and using.

  This is my preschooler's second Melissa and Doug costume (he also has the fire fighter set). This is very high quality. He loves the walkie talkie that comes with it. My only complaint is the whistle they include. Not many parents want their kids blowing a whistle around the house. It also seemed a little small, making me worried about choking hazard (we ended up hiding it, because we also have a 17 month old and I really don't want her to have it for safety reasons, but also I don't want them both mouthing it and sharing germs). Perhaps a better accessory would have been a holder or pad to go along with the ticket (which my son loves to give out, by the way). Overall a great item that encourages role play with kids.

Both kids had a great time ""arresting"" and giving tickets to the adults. They argued a bit over who got to wear the police costume and the other got ""stuck"" with the fire chief until time to switch, lol. This is a great purchase and I plan to use it at Halloween as well to save buying another costume.UPDATE: He is 5 now and this is still a hit!

  I bought this for my 6 year old grandson who is rather small for his age. It fit him perfectly and he loved it. The quality of the material was very good as was the sewing. He had fun with all the extras that came with it such as handcuffs, whistle, etc. A few extra copies of the infraction tickets would have been nice.  Overall I was very satisfied.

  Well made, has lots of fun perks (radio, whistle, ticket, handcuffs, badge). Have to admit we ""lost"" the batteries to the radio, and the whistle disappears sometimes too.  We also bought the construction worker and firefighter outfits all for our son's 3rd birthday (he wears a 4t). They are pretty big on him, which he doesn't like, I think he would play with them more often if they fit better - but he'll grow into them.

  Amazing price for such a good quality product! I ordered this, along with 2 others in the collection, on a Saturday morning and received it on Monday afternoon. Also, I paid only $5 shipping and handling for the entire order! What a deal. I was very impressed with the quality of the outfits and the amount of extras that were included. Out of the three outfits there was only one defect (missing earpiece on stethoscope). The outfits all have pockets, velcro closures, headpieces, name tags, and at least 3 accessories that make play dress up so much fun for my 4 1/2 year old. The size of the outfits are appropriate as well. They make great Halloween costumes, too, and are so much less expensive.

It does come with a few small parts that are easy to lose, such as the badge on the hat, which kept falling off and was soon lost. But in general it's been a great buy.

  You will not regret buying this for your preschooler. My 4-year-old son put the jacket and hat on and was instantly transformed! He spent the rest of the night placing the lot of us under arrest and in handcuffs. This policeman jacket set is made of high-quality, machine washable fabric, and so is the hat. The accessories are a walkie-talkie (requires a 9v battery for activating the sounds), a set of handcuffs, a police whistle (which isn't too shrill, thank goodness), and a shiny police badge. The ID card and ""ticket"" is not made of cardboard and meant to be taken our of the pocket and put back in hundreds of times.

The costumes are well made, easy to get in and out of and include a badge that can be personalized for the child. We have taken his picture and put his name on the badge that stays in a clear plastic badge holder on the front of the costume. My grandson had friends over and each of them put on the costumes. This was a great gift and I am very happy. The items that come with each costume make the cost very reasonable. There are at least 4 accessories with each costume.

  I bought this for my train loving son.  It does look cute on him but is baggier than I would like.  He just turned 4 and is big for his age.  I was worried about ordering this because I read some reviews that said the hat was too small.  The hat that came with mine has elastic in the back and will be plenty big for any childs head which makes me think they must of updated the costume.  I thought the walkie talkie did not work but it just did not come with batteries.  It is a nice addition to the play factor and makes train sounds at a very low volume (thank goodness!).

  The Train Engineer Role Play Costume is built to last.  The good quality fabric is sturdy and construction is top notch.  The hat has elastic to allow for varying head sizes.  Our two and a half year old runs for the outfit as soon as we set up the train set and call, “All aboard!”The little one wears a 3T and the costume is a bit large (hits well below the knee), but it is so cute on and will be wearable for years to come.  With the side Velcro, it is quick to put on and take off.  The accessories are all fun to use.  A great purchase!

  This set is very well made of high quality fabric with and child tough stitching.  The velcro fasteners make it easy to put on and take off.  Although the tools are plastic, they are still functional.  The walkie talkie requires a battery in order to work.  It lights up, and says something unintelligible and has a siren sound.  Might be better suited for a police role play suit than a train engineer.  The name tag and train schedule are plastic coated and appear to be for dry erase markers.My five year old grandson thought it was great and he wore it when we took him on his first real train ride.  I would recommend the Melissa and Doug role playing outfits to parents and grandparents as they feed a young child's imagination and serve to open up numerous educational opportunities to involve children in something besides video games or TV.

  I got this train engineer costume for my petite 6 year old son. He absolutely loves it!!! The apron or bib is roomy and probably fits him many more years. It doesn't look sloppy big, just has enough room to grow. For sizing, I think it would fit regular size 7 year old kid. All the accessories are well made. Only thing to complain is the walky talky needs a 9 V battery. I just wished it could use AAA or AA batteries. The walky talky has train sound that is not too loud. He wore it for his school's career day, but I plan for him to use for Halloween, possibly in many more years. Good investment...

  My train-loving toddler loves this thing, but I only gave it 3 stars for a few reasons, first, the first set we received was broken/torn, luckily amazon accepted it back right away and we were able to get a refund and order a new one. Second, the hat seems pretty small. I have a 3 year old and he won't wear the hat because it is too tight, and he has an average sized head. Next, the walkie-talkie is SUPER LOUD and has no volume control, and the walkie-talkie plays train sounds, which doesn't make much sense to me. Finally, there are no directions as to what type of pens will work best on the tickets so we don't actually write on those when we play.I do like that it is washable (or so it says, I haven't washed it yet) and my child loves it, so that's what matters.

  My 3 year old son is obsessed with anything having to do with trains. On his birthday he wore this costume so he could be a Jr. Engineer :) The accompanying tools, radio and train schedule gave him hours of play time. The only drawback is the ""radio"" is SUPER LOUD! There is no volume, and the train whistle recording on it startled my son several times. The buttons were also hard for him to depress. The quality of construction of the costume surpassed my expectations. The pockets are sewn well even though they are a thick see-through plastic. The fabric is a heavier durable, washable, and soft material. The sides are kept together with velcro...I would have liked to see an adjustable slip tie in the back for my skinnier guy. Overall an excellent, non-cartoon specific train related outfit to encourage role play for my son.

  Purchased this for my 2 year old son who is obsessed with trains. He loves wearing it. It velcros on one side so it is easy to take off and put on. We were able to customize his name badge with his name and picture. The material is good quality- I haven't had to wash it yet however so I don't know how it will wash. The walkie talkie and tools and schedule have all been played with and fit in the pockets nicely. My son is in a size 3t and it is a little big on him but it doesn't bother him at all. He wears the hat everywhere, even to bed for naps. He's happy so I'm happy. We are definitely getting our money's worth with this item!

  I have a son who just turned 3 in January and I'd wanted to start promoting his love of make-believe with some hats for dress up. Of course he has a firefighter one already and I thought an engineer cap would suit him perfectly, what with our huge Melissa & Doug train set and his adoration of Thomas since he was old enough to point to a train! When reviewing my options, I came across this role play set and decided it'd be worth the investment because it came with so many items that we could use in a variety of ways. The hat and apron are sturdy and adorable. The train schedule is part of what makes it a bit more educational, though I believe the educational level of any toy is what you make of it when playing and teaching your child. These things alone would have been enough, but the set comes with bonus items: a walkie talkie, hammer and wrench, all of which go in my son's tool box now. So they can be used for playing more than just trains. Very pleased with this purchase.

  We purchased this dress up outfit to be my 4 year old's Halloween costume this year and are so pleased with it. In comparison to one of the cruddy costumes sold at the big box stores this thing will not tear easily, its not see through and it comes with all its accessories (instead of having to buy them piece meal). My son has worn it to 2 costume parties and a haunted house adventure and so far its holding up great to regular little boy rough play time! The only addition I made was a red neck kerchief and that I borrowed from last years cowboy costume. I'd have to say this is a hit in our house and we will be buying some of the other sets as Yule gifts.

  My grandson loves hats so this was great to wear while he played with his new train he received for Christmas.  When I showed him how the radio made real train sounds he thought that was the best but the radio lasted about two minutes and then the sounds became distorted and just alot of very loud noise.  I removed the battery and replaced it to see if that would do anything (It didn't) I have to say the radio is just a piece of plastic junk.  Amazon is replacing with free return and replacement, hopefully the replacement lasts long enough to allow my grandson to enjoy it.

  My nephew is obsessed with trains. I bought this as a gift for his 7th birthday. I was a bit worried about sizing, since one reviewer bought it for their 3 year old and the manufacturer lists the ages as 3-6. I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. It fit him perfectly! The minute he unwrapped this, his eyes lit up and he begged to put it on. He has barely taken it off since! It was a huge hit. It also fits his younger brother, who is a small-for-his-age 5 year old, so it really can work for a variety of ages.The quality of this costume is excellent. It doesn't feel cheap or chintzy like some children's costumes I have seen. The material is thick and stitched strongly. The buttons on the shoulder straps are tightly sewn, so they won't pop off easily. It isn't the type of costume that is going to fall apart in one wash. This is something that will last in the dress up trunk for years. I definitely plan to buy more costumes in the Melissa & Doug line!

  My 3 year old son likes wearing this and it fits him well. The tools, pockets, etc really go the extra mile to make this something that will get played with. Everything is sewn to the overall and you need to cut the threads to separate it, this was ok with the tools, but the hat a few stitches that were very tight and I was afraid I was going to cut the hat while trying to cut the stitches, it seemed like overkill and unnecessary. I was surprised to find the little radio actually works (not as a radio, just makes a train sound), it requires a 9v battery, not included, and after hearing how LOUD this is, I wished I had just left the battery out for pretend play. Its a very loud train whistle and bell and even my son covered his ears and said it was so loud. Overall, very cute though.

  I tried it on and WOW I think it looks amazing... but I don’t think I’ll be able to wear it considering I’ll be too cold, so I’ll be returning it :( However, this could definitely be a good costume for role play. That’s not my sort of thing but I know a lot of people enjoy that so that’s a way you could get good use of it. Because of how limited it is with skin coverage, I think I’ll probably return but it is definitely a great costume to feel sexy in.

  First let me say that the only reason I knocked off a star is that this costume was a bit smaller than expected. It does fit my son and we're keeping it as he will be wearing it within the month and will probably still be able to get into it for at least the next few months (something my kids love to do with their Halloween costumes) when he wants it to play around. But it is almost a bit tight in the waist although my son is only a size 7 and very very slim (we purchased the 7/8). Not uncomfortably so, but if you're in doubt, I'd recommend getting the next size up from what you think your child should be wearing.With that said, yes, it's a bit flimsy as would be expected for a once-wear item, but it's adorable and my son absolutely loves it. The hat is super-cute as well. The green is very vibrant, just like the video game and just what we were looking for. I really couldn't beat the price, either. I saw this exact costume on other sites and via other sellers and this was the lowest price I found. So I was very happy about that.My son is running all over the house in it right now and can't wait to wear it for his Halloween parade at school.

  If it was up to my son it would get 5 stars. I actually was going ro give 3 stars and see how happy he is each time he puts it on and extra star for my kids happiness. Costume is thin material my son can get in and out without any help. The mustache is the worst. Just one stick. (May not be one to share) the glue in the back doesn't hold well so it kept falling off. Now th glue tape has peeled off and mustache is worthless. Kind of defeats the whole Luigi thing. Son was so bummed about that. But he still puts it on and tries to do the best luigi impression.

  Sizing was perfect for my 6 1/2 year old he’s tall and there’s still  room that it would likely fit for another year if he wants.

  Due to availability the week of Halloween I had to buy a size up. But the size 7-8 worked fine for my 5 yr old ...a little rolling up on the sleeves and he's good to go. It's an adorable costume if you have a super Mario lover. It's thin but that's fine, you just layer it over clothes. The mustache is a one time use sticker though. The hat shape is super cute. It wasn't an odd shape from the packaging. This is a costume that will be worn even after Halloween, as he pretends to be Luigi and runs around our backyard.

  Love the costume. My son adores it. But one thing I didn't think of before purchasing this was the hands. My son says he's missing the hands. Now that I am looking on Amazon for gloves I see some costumes do have gloves. This one does not. To buy the gloves separate it's an extra $15 compared to buying the costume with gloves for an additional $5

Velcro di chiusura resistente. Cappello realizzato di materiale buono che mantiene la forma. C'erano anche i baffi, anche se dopo il primo utilizzo non attaccavano più molto bene (ma non pretendevo baffi riutilizzabili)!Direi tutti molto soddisfatti. Oltre al carnevale abbiamo utilizzato il costume anche per il LUCCA COMICS ed è stato un successone!!MOLTO CONTENTI TUTTI!!Spero di essere stata utile!

  I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter for our Disney cruise. Even with all these dresses straight from Disney all over the ship, this dress was more beautiful than 99% of the others. It was so well made, and no glitter going everywhere. I definitely encourage you to buy this if you are thinking about it. I'm going to look for other dresses from this company.

  Second dress I bought from this company and couldn’t be more happy with the purchase!The dress is so beautifully made and doesn’t look or feel anything like the cheap costume kind.Everything came packaged neatly and protected.Showed up in great time.Dress itself is satiny feel. There’s a cloth layer on the inside so it won’t be scratchy when wearing.There’s elastic at the neck so the dress will comfortably stay up.Getting the accessories with the dress was well worth it! The gloves are DARLING!! The necklace is stretchy. Only thing worried about is the crown it creaked a little when I tried to bend it to put it on the band so we’ll see if that jewel pops up but that’s an easy fix.Highly highly recommend the rapunzel, sleeping beauty and Snow White dresses with accessories.

  Beautiful well made dress. My three year old loves it! I bought a size 5 and it actually fits her fine(she’s a little tall) so I would say it runs slightly small. The glittery decoration on the skirt is so pretty and doesn’t shed glitter. I was worried about the mesh sleeves getting holes easily but my daughter has been pretty rough with them and they have held up. Nothing has been damaged or come off of the dress and we got it two weeks ago, she wears it often. I’m very happy with the value from the cost. It’s a gorgeous dress.

  My 2-yr-old is not old enough to go to the Bippidi Boppidi salon at Disney World, but her cousin was going so we bought this dress to princessify my daughter so she wouldn't be jealous. It's a beautiful dress and the 3T fit my almost 3-yr-old perfectly. It's very good quality, the fabric is soft and the seams are solid and serged. They used several different fabrics to give it depth. I was impressed that they put a half-slip inside the crinoline to keep it from being scratchy. It mostly stood up to one day in the park and one day of traveling through airports (she refused to wear anything else to travel home). One seam near the bottom did rip so I'll have to repair that, but she's a rambunctious toddler. Overall, I'd recommend this dress and buy others from this company.

  I bought this in a size 4 for my granddaughter's recent fourth birthday and it fits nicely. She's kind of tall and thin so take that into consideration when ordering. The dress has no buttons or zippers to aid in getting it on and off, although there is a little stretch in the waist. It just gets pulled over the child's head or up over her hips. This is what's most important to consider in the dress fitting, unless you are a seamstress and want to modify it.The material is very pretty and soft against the skin thanks to lining. There's lots of fullness in the skirt and netting to support it. It was long enough to touch the floor and a bit too long for much activity. She stepped on it a time or two running around and nearly falling, so full of her birthday excitement.The sleeves are a lightweight, sheer/opaque fabric that also encircles the neck behind the collar and modestly covering the chest area.ReliBeauty shipped quickly, packaged their product well, and delivered within my expectations. I would order from them again.

  For the price, this was a great quality dress.  Purchased for Disney World and our Perfectly Princess Tea Party with Princess Aurora.  As 5 year olds do, my daughter threw a fit and insisted on wearing a Belle dress instead, but another girl in the group actually was wearing this dress.  Price point makes it a popular option, and it won't disappoint.One recommendation though, take the pin off the dress before wearing - or at the very least before she takes it off.  The dress fits so tight, when you pull the dress over her head it's nearly impossible not to scratch your child with it.  Another reviewer commented on this too- I just forgot until it happened to us.

  This dress is beautiful and the quality is great. I think the quality is much better than the expensive dresses from the Disney store. The size runs true; my daughter wears a size 6 and the size 6 dress fits perfectly. The skirt is full and poofy and covered in gold designs. The sleeves are sheer but re material is thicker and more durable than other Disney dresses.

  Was really impressed with the quality of the costume and the accessories for the price.  My 2 year old wore it for Halloween, she was a ""princess ballerina"" and she was obsessed with this dress.  It was big enough that she wore it over a long sleeve shirt and pants.  One strange thing, though; I accidentally bought 2 and so when I opened the box I was surprised.  However.  The first package I opened had a TERRIBLE chemical/fishy smell that made me want to throw up.  Oddly enough, when we opened the second costume, there was NO SMELL and it was absolutely perfect.  So we returned the smelly costume and it worked out having had bought two accidentally.

  Absolutely stunning!!! Worth every penny!!! My daughter is a tall, thin 4 year old...so I bought the size 5 and 6/6x just to compare. The 5 is exactly her size, but it will only last maybe a year. So I decided to return that and instead went with the 6/6x. It's roomy in the bodice for her to grow into and the length doesn't appear to be a huge difference between the two sizes. She's not swimming in it, but has room to grow. It's too gorgeous not to have for a few years. Must Buy!!

  This dress is beautiful, good quality fabric and the glitter doesn't fall and scatter every where. the size was perfect. I ordered a size up so she can wear it longer, however, the dress had a awful smell of chemicals. I washed on a delicate cycle and that took care of the smell. The dress washed good, no shrinkage, fading or tears. I let it air-dry. All the little accessories are cheap and will probably break before she leaves the house. I will purchase more dresses from this company.

  Just so pleased. Beautiful, well-made, nice material, lined and as another customer said, not ""cheap costume"" dress. I really can't say enough. This is the only seller from whom I will now buy princess dresses. Terrific value for price. I bought a size 5 for my  3 1/2 -foot tall, 42 pound granddaughter, and it's a great fit (including length). There is just a bit of room from growth, but I wasn't buying for room to grow. If you're looking, don't think twice. BUY IT!!! Also, dress was delivered on time. I also purchased a different style for other granddaughter, and had just as many great things to say about that dress as I did this one. For those wondering, I think the dresses probably run pretty true to size, I bought 3T-4T in the other dress for the granddaughter who wears a 4T.

  This dress is absolutely perfect and the quality is awesome compared to what you find in the stores.  I can't recommend it enough.  We purchased it for our daughter who was having a makeover at Disney's Bippitybop Boutique.  The fairy godmothers kept complimenting on how much they loved the dress and even grabbed one of the over priced Disney ones to compare and thought this was better made and looked closer to the Aurora dress.  They loved how the shoulders were designed!  Overall, very satisfied and would buy again if needed.  Our daughter now uses it for dress up and it has held up better than any other play clothes!

  The dress is beautifully made. The craftsmanship and material quality is more than what I had expected. It’s design is actually closer to the actual Aurora/sleeping beauty character. Better than the one from the Disney store and almost half the cost. I love it. My daughter is thrilled. I got the size 4/5 for my taller than average three year old and it fits perfect. It is floor length with a bit of a poof which gives the total princess ballroom gown look. Not flat and not overly poofy. Just right. I just wish the cotton lining of the dress would be a bit thicker, but so far it protects from the scratchiness of the tulle layer.

  My 5-year-old has long legs but the size 6 dress was out of stock so I ordered the size 5. It was barely short like not even noticeable. I bought her this dress with accessories and took her to a princess ball for her birthday. The material and quality were so much better than expected. It was just gorgeous and she had one of the prettiest dresses there. After the ball, she has been playing in it almost daily and it has held up better than expensive dresses we have bought. I ordered her a mermaid costume for these same sellers for Christmas and it looks so beautiful as well (I had to open it and look before I wrapped it).

  This is so worth the money. It’s good for dress up or a fancy Halloween. We have some name brand dresses from a famous mouse company that shall not be name, and this dress is as good if not better made then those dresses. The glitter is really on there. The material is soft for synthetic material (doesn’t feel like plastic). There is a light petticoat to poof out the dress some but if you want it super poofy get a petticoat. I personally think it’s perfect as is though. It is a more traditional pink dress so not hot pink, think cotton candy or bubblegum. There is a lining for the skirt part of the dress to keep it from being scratchy with the under petticoat which is a muslin/cotton like material. There is this soft mesh material for the sleeves and it carries up to the neck. It is perfect for those tiny shoulders of your toddler or kiddo. I will be buying more from this company,  Relibeauty. Love love love this princess dress

  Taking our girl to the bibbity bobbity boutique next week and wanted to save a little money by bringing our own dress. This dress is better quality and a fraction of the price than the Disney store gowns. My 7 year old is a size 8, and this fits great. The length is probably above the ankle on her, but she’s a on the taller side of her age group. She’s also thin, and this dress gives a little more room in the body, so it’s not exactly form fitting on her, but that’s great in my opinion and will let her wear it longer. If you’re buying it for play - it’s great quality and should last a long time! If you’re buying it for a party or for Disney like us, I would definitely use a steamer and get rid of all of those wrinkles from being shipped. It makes a world of difference! Especially if photos will be involved!

  This is a well made, sturdy princess costume.  My grand daughter lived in it for days before finally agreeing to take it off when she went home.  It comes with some fun accessories like gloves and a wand, think some jewelry too.  It's heavier than a Halloween costume and the inside has a sort of t-shirt which holds up the pointy sleeves.

  I bought this as a gift for my daughter’s 4th birthday. She loves it! She is pretty petite and I was worried it would be too big but it fits perfectly. All of the reviews I read said this is a company whose products are well made and it was. So much attention to detail! The only problem is it’s a little tough to get on/off. There isn’t a zipper so we struggle a bit to get it off which ripped a little bit of the mesh material along the collar. I still think it’s a great product for the money paid but I wish we didn’t have to be so careful.

  I've been purchasing ReliBeauty princess gowns for my little grand-princess for several years, and they have always been beautiful and beautifully sewn.  She is fast growing out of her ""princess stage"", but these dresses are so well made, and there are other little princesses-in-waiting who will be able to wear them, and they will then be able to  pass them on to the next little princess-in-waiting.  They are well worth the money.  If you think you can run one of these costumes up on your sewing machine Grandma, go ahead, give it a try.  But they'll never come out as nice as these.

  I bought a princess Aurora dress from the website momapprovedcostumes.com but I was afraid it would not arrive on time for the birthday girl. I bought the Relibeauty Auroa dress as back up for the birthday in case the other didn't arrive. Well the other Aurora dress did arrive on time, it was pretty and was more play friendly, had a simple 1 layer skirt with no puffiness to it which is a bit easier to play in it. But hands down the Reliabeauty Aurora dress was far more beautiful than the momapprovedcostumes dress. It was more princess looking with the tulle glitter overlay, tulle underskirt, no itch skirt linin, and vibrant pink shimmer colors. Both dresses had the shirt style top so it was easy for on/off.  I was sad that I couldn't keep both dresses, but with amazon's free returns I had to return the Reliabeauty dress. I was already in the whole for paying extra shipping on the momapprovedcostumes dress. Maybe when we outgrow the momapprovedcostumes.com dress I will re order the Reliabeauty dress because it's gorgeous, well made, and comfy and it was better priced.

  I would highly recommend the dress but not the accessories. The dress is beautiful for the price but the accessories are not worth any money at all. My wand came with the jewel pieces broken out in the bag. The earrings came broken as only one had the clip for clipping onto the ear. And lastly the crown it came beautifully placed in the bag it was packaged in but in taking it out of the bag and trying to fit the crown together I quickly realized the crown would not click on as it was supposed to because the circle on the tiara, that clicked onto the peg on the head piece, was cracked in half and would not stay connected to the peg.

  My daughter is a little fashionista/princess.  She loves this one.  The quality is great!  With other dresses with the wide shoulder look, I felt like the dress it's self kept slipping down too low.  This has a mesh that goes over he shoulders- so it stays up and is comfortable.  She's not having to readjust it over and over again.  I did buy it a size bigger than she needed, but that was intentional. Kids grow so fast, and I wanted for her to be able to wear it for a year.  I am glad I did- it's a little big, but she'll get to use it for at least a year- if not 18 months.

It is an inch or two about the ground so it doesn’t drag on the ground and get dirty.Cons: There is more glitter around my house then on the dress.

The quality was really so good, I feel it was better than you’ll find at most places, maybe even the actual Disney version. We have washed it already and it held up really well, I just hang dry to be on the safe side. It does give off a little gold glitter from the skirt, but it’s not terrible. I would say the sizing is roomy. My daughter wears 4 exactly and the size 4 was roomy. I was happy with it though bc I like to size up so she can get use out of it for some time still!

  ReliBeauty really makes the best costume dresses for little kids. They are gorgeous, fully lined in cotton lining so nothing is itchy against your child's skin (for the sensitive ones like mine), even the sleeves are a soft chiffon type material, not that itchy fishnet mesh you can get on the cheaper factory costumes. Mine even held up to a gentle/hand wash cycle in the washing machine (not sure if that's recommended but my daughter wore it to school and spilled lunch on it). We didn't even lose a sequin and the stains came out with only Woolite! This is the 3rd princess dress I have purchased from ReliBeauty and finally left review because they are that awesome. We have Rapunzel, Belle and now Aurora. I'm sure we will be adding to the collection soon. You can't go wrong. Worth twice the money!

  I bought this Rapunzel dress for my neighbor's daughter for her birthday. She loves all the pricess things and dress up. I was actually surprised at the quality right out of the box. It fit her perfectly (i got a 7/8) and it has some extra room so she will be able to wear it over the next year. It has a pretty sheer overlay and some fine details in the sewing that is not cheap, It's beautiful! The look on her face when she saw it was priceless and it didnt hurt my budget.Really lovely, I would recommend it highly!

  Wow! This dress is absolutely amazing! Fits true to size! My daughter wears a 3T and that’s what I ordered. The only thing I didn’t like was the smell of the dress. Very bad stench. Hopefully once it’s air dried then the smell will go away. The gloves are a bit big, but that’s such a minor detail. Would definitely recommend!

  All my daughter wants for Christmas is an Aurora dress. I tried a couple other ones but the colors were weird and I wasn’t happy with the look. The ReliBeauty one was a much nicer color and better quality.Unfortunately my daughter had a growth spurt after I ordered it and I was worried she’d no longer be able to fit a 3T. ReliBeauty was kind enough to help me with a return so I could order a replacement, even though my return window with Amazon had closed.

  Such a pretty Princess Aurora dress.  My daughter will be Princess Aurora for Halloween this year.  My favorite part about this dress is the sleeves.  It's just so pretty and elegant.  Most Princess Aurora dress out there doesn't have one like this.  If there is one, the material used are super itchy.  But the one used for this dress is nice and comfortable.

  So let my start off by saying that this is one of the best quality costume dresses I’ve ever seen! The quality is exceptional. It’s just lovely!! When I showed it to my husband he thought it was something I bought for myself! Also a great value with all the bells and whistles that all little girls love, the Tiara, gloves, earrings, etc. were all nicely packaged and looked to be intact. I wanted to get an array of costume dresses for my soon to be 4 year old for her birthday. She is very tall, like in the 90th percentile for height. I almost always have to size up for her for clothes and sadly I feel that every size chart is a guessing game due to different sellers, I have ordered the same size (6x140) in dresses/costumes/clothes as I did in this and they end up being too small....and this was at least two sizes too big, So this does in fact run VERY close to true size and if only I could trust size charts would I have picked her appropriate size, Or let’s say accurate size and then account for getting a size she can grow into. That being said, I have actually considered keeping this for two years so she will have one that fits her when she’s 6 or 7! It’s that beautiful! But who knows what she will like in 2-3 years so I’m going to return it for a smaller size, and get my younger daughter one as well! I have a two year old that loves playing dress up with her sister. Very pleased with this product and would recommend you go by this sellers sizing!

  The dress is great and perfect my low score is do to the fact the I spent extra to get the accessories and all I received was the dress which again is beautiful but I feel kind of ripped off cause if I just wanted the dress I would have saved some money and just ordered the dress but now I need to spend more money to get what should have come with the dress don't get jipped too just buy the dress and things separate

  My 7 year old daughter loves everything about this costume! It is beautiful & amazing quality. The only issue is sizing. She runs quite true to a size 8, but this is pretty big on her. We definitely make it work, & she loves it! So it isn’t that big of a deal. All the accessories are pretty cheaply made, though. The wand was broken right out of the box, so we ordered another.

  It’s a little big. Purchase for a Halloween costume for my five yr old. She’s about fifty pounds and tall for her age. So I got the bigger size. It’s a little long but will be okay with child heeled dress shoes. It is too big in the chest and bodice but not falling off. She should get lots of play time out of it. Rather have too big than too small. The fabric quality is fantastic which is what I was hoping for. Would definitely buy again. It’s not itchy or scratchy and you get accessories worth it. Bonus!  Gloves are a bit snug.

  I am so impressed with the quality of these dresses, I have bought 4 different princesses!  For ~$25, I have to be honest and say,  I was expecting less from overall quality but was pleasantly pleased to see I was wrong. Would definitely recommend!!!  Will be buying from them again!  True to size so if you want for more time I would get the next size, will just be a little long!  This is what I did, still fit around shoulders so the dress didn’t fall.

  I ordered the 4/5 for my tall 3 year old, she absolutely loves it,  she has to wear it for dress up almost every day, Its been washed on gentle cycle inside out and hung up to dry, and it came out perfectly. No shrinking ,no rips or dethreading. Definitely a 5 star dress for a rambunctious 3 year old to play in. P.s. its also perfect with a petty coat underneath.

  I love the shine of this dress, looks like a real princess gown!  Fit is as expected (2year old wearing mostly 3T) zips on over clothes easily.  It is a little bit long, but not so much that she trips on it, so fine for in the house.  I would take it up if we were going out in it.  Fully (lightly) lined so no seams to irritate delicate skin. The accessories are eh, but shiny- the wand and necklace survived the first day, and the crown, ring, and earrings broke almost immediately but haven’t been tossed yet because she puts the loose bits in bags and purses with other treasures to carry around.

  I got this dress for my granddaughter's 7th birthday and she looked absolutely beautiful. I bought the size 7/8 which was a little large in the top (My granddaughter is petite) but my daughter in law just pinned it and you couldn't even tell. The crown and gloves completed the look and she looked like a little princess doing her princess wave for her driveby birthday! Itmade her day! The dress shipped fast and I actually received it before the estimated ship day which was great because I was cutting it close to get there in time. Highly recommend you can't go wrong!!

  The dress and accessories were so much better than expected. The quality is great (thick fabric and well sewn dress) and I would buy this again. It's not like a cheap Halloween costume at all. There was a problem with one of the accessories and the seller sent another dress and an accessories bag! That's really going above and beyond customer service. I'd definitely order from this seller again.

  Very very cute! Very soft, my daughters loved them! I bought a matching one for my older daughter as well. Surprising thin, but could fit thicker clothes underneath to keep them warm in colder climates. They were their for halloween in about 30°F temperature and didnt complain about being cold with thick clothes underneath. The hats fit well, especially with the velcro strap. Would recommend for any unicorn fans.

  My girl was just one week shy of turning 2 years old. Very warm and soft costume.  Only needed one layer underneath. My only complaint is the head would fall and get in her eyes which she didn't like, and I feel like she has a pretty decent sized noggin. Also, the 5 million buttons on the pants were excessive.  I would still 100% buy this again though!!! She got so many compliments and the pictures we got were great. Wasn't a bad price either. Would recommend.

  We have purchased so many costumes over the years that are not good quality and break easily. This costume is made well. It is super soft, fits as expected and kept our little one nice and toasty while trick or treating. Most importantly, the head piece stays on! We have some costumes where the head piece slides all over and makes it so that the kid doesn't want to wear it.

  I love this for my 15 month old daughter. It is cold and snowy here so it helps keep her a little warmer. I got her a 12-18m. She is 23lb and 32in, and it fits perfectly with a little room for clothes underneath. It is very soft and nicely made. It has little snap buttons inside the legs that go all the way around making it easy for diaper changes which is nice. I love that it comes with the booties and a wand. Such a cute costume!

  I was extremely impressed with this costume's detail and quality! A costume like this could be a lot more expensive, especially considering all the accessories it came with- a wand, wings, cute feet to go over the shoes, head piece, and attached mane and tail. The costume was also very soft and fuzzy and I didn't have to worry too much about layering a ton of clothes underneath because the costume was warm. I HIGHLY recommend this costume and am so pleased this is the one I chose for my 2 year old's first trick or treating experience!

  My daughter loves it, after we tryed it on she wouldn't take it off.  The head piece is very nice and soft. The body pice is super soft, the tail is the softest. The star wand was just the cutest. Definitely recommend, great value for the price.

  Cutest thing I’ve ever seen!! I do with it was Velcro or a zipper instead of snaps that cover the entire inner legs of the outfit, you ever wrestle a 2 year old to get dressed? How about wrestling them to get dressed in rip away track pants but backwards

  This was perfect for my 14 month old. She got so many compliments. I ordered the 18-24month size because she wears mostly size 18mo. The legs were pretty long for her, but there are snaps up the both legs so I just adjusted and we didn’t have any issues with tripping while wearing her regular shoes.

  Okay my daughter was tooooo freaking cute in this costume, I loved it, all the people we saw loved it, she did not love the hat so much. it made it very difficult for her to see, to the point where I held up the nose for basically 2 hours trick or treating. What I wish I had known is that I could safety pin it to the rest of the costume to prevent such an annoyance. Alas I had no safety pins and neither did any of the houses we trick or treated at, or so they said. Should have tried it on before Halloween I guess.

  Bought this for our baby to go trick or treating in Salt Lake City, which gets pretty cold during Halloween. The body part is fuzzy but pretty porous so we had to put on a jacket. It won't fall apart and pretty well constructed. Very cute. Size is true. Just a bit cold.

  I live in Southeast Michigan. Halloween can be a little chilly. This costume is perfect. It is exactly as the pictures depict. Delivered next day and without damage. I purchased 18-24 month to allow for clothing underneath for my 15 month old. It pulls over and has snaps up both legs and in the crotch area. Reasonably priced good product. I would purchase again.

  The costume is true to size, has very bright colors and is made of soft material flexible enough for little kids movement. The only problem was the order seemed to be missing the wings and wand.

  The costume has a big patch on the left arm with the words ""tipsyelves®"" in bright white on the green background, and also four zippers, all with ""tipsyelves®"" in bright white on a green background (zippers that would be hard to hide in the interior of the costume). All to make sure everyone who sees you out for Halloween knows where you bought your costume. It being store bought isn't the issue, of course it doesn't look home made, but a good costume should be about the costume itself, not an advertisement for the company. (Also, it's small for the size listed.)

  Bought this for my daughters birthday party and she loved it. When it comes out of the beg it looks a bit creased but like the instructions tell you the wrinkles disappear after an hour or so. The only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is because after an hour somehow the yellow ribbon straps got ripped out but luckily I was able to thread it back in.I chose this one because it came with the cowgirl hat and bandana and thus was a cheaper and cuter outfit then buying another cowgirl one.

  Purchased this for my 6 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. I couldn't get her to take it off once she realized she had some cute cowgirl boots to match. It fit her great and didn't show too much leg. The ribbons on the dress are adjustable. You can easily weed them into another part of the dress. That made it great because we ended up making two shoulder straps with the ribbons. My only downer, the ""cow"" material could've been attacked a little better. My daughter likes to explore her outfits and she pulled it right off with a simple tug. Could've been a simple error. It was a quick fix. Definitely looking forward to finding more costumes like this one.

  The outfit was cute, but the hat was totally messed up, the way it was packed the hat was folded in half, it had creases and the top was creased. Was very disappointed but since my granddaughter opened the box I couldn’t send it back, also the back of the dress part of the elastic is coming apart. There was nothing to hold the ribbons up in the back so they keep coming untied.

  Inexpensive wigs generally don't look like the pictures, at least without a lot of manipulation before wearing. That isn't the case here; looks like the picture right out of the box. This feels higher quality and looks more realistic than most wigs in this price range. Other wigs are thin and ratty in the back, but this one was very full and a perfect length. Reasonable quality construction, didn't lose a lot of strands, held its form, and stayed in place all night.I like it wery much.

  In my past cosplay experience, it's usually true that you get what you pay for; but this is not the case with this Spidey suit!! Got it for the Spiderman Homecoming premier and I really do feel like the bug boy himself when I put it on!I am 5'11, and the medium fits fine but if I had even another two inches I would recommend the next size up. I have it stretched to the limit, but that's just because I prefer to wear it tight (being disproportionately skinny for my height). I've got a 28"" midriff and 45"" shoulders, and the medium fit great in both places. The crotch comes a little low (leg shafts a bit too short), but I can't blame anyone for that because I have freakishly long legs for a human being. If you too have an absurdly lengthy lower torso, you should be able to pin thr crotch up a little bit so that you don't have quite as much of a  web in your thigh gap. Plus that helps to show off the hot cross buns 🔥

  Hey everyone, so I just tried on this costume and I have to say...It's pretty freaking awesome and here's why:Let's start with the fit. I'm 5'9 160 pounds, athletic build and I bought a size medium. When I first put on the costume I was wearing only ankle socks and some compression boxer briefs. There's two zippers on the back that meet. One starts at the lower back and the other one at the top of the back of the head. Slipping on the feet portions of the costume was a challenge, but I wear size 11's so that's pretty big for my height. After I stepped into the legs and did that I slipped into the arms and hands no problem. The real challenge was zipping up the back by myself! I have a rather large head so my biggest worry was the fit of the mask, but that fit perfectly! Seeing through the eyes isn't great but that's too be expected if you don't want your eyes to be seen. It took me about 2 minutes of fanagling to zip up the back but I go it. It's important that I tell you that the mask is attached to the costume. This may discourage you, but based on the thinness of the costume you can easily tuck the mask in the front and play the role of a Peter Parker who needs some fresh air. However this was already thought about by the designer which is why the area where your nose and mouth is is even thinner then the rest. This is done effectively without giving up appearance quality. Tucking the mask in will leave the back wide open due to the upper zipper being pulled so possibly a red compression shirt would work best for those of you who want to take the mask off frequently. Anyways, so the fit is fantastic! I feel like this costume was created just for me! It fits perfectly in all the right places. It's really a credit to Rubies. This is a quality product from what I can see.Okay, so now let's talk about appearance. Wow. This costume could not be more true to the comic book colors and design of the Spider-man we all love. It looks even better than the picture on here! One this that really bothered me about other costumes I've looked at is that the back of the costume was blank or the exact same black spider on both sides. That's just lazy. Rubie's stays true to the comics by having a large red spider on the back. If you still need another reason to buy this costume then look no further than the PRICE. I paid $33 for mine. Are you serious? What a steal. Buy this costume right now! You will not regret it! Feel free to ask me any questions. I will reply quickly being as I am always on my phone. Thank you for reading!

  After reading the reviews, I ordered a men's medium for my almost 12 year old daughter.  She is 5 ft 1 inches and about 80 to 85 pounds. (Skinny kid)  She loves Spider-man and wanted to be Spider-man (for about the 4th year in a row!) but didn't want a costume that had ""muscles"" on it since she was a girl.  This fit perfectly.  It did have some extra room in it, but not too much... if you have some ""extra"" in the belly area, it may not fit as well.  She really looked like Spider-Man from the movies!! Everyone absolutely LOVED her in the costume.  The face mask has holes in the mouth area, the eye area, and maybe the nose area (I can't remember), but they are tiny enough holes that you don't notice unless you are up close to her, but large enough that she was fine wearing it all day.  It also held up pretty well.  She wore it to an indoor Halloween Trick or Treat event, traditional outdoor Trick or Treating, and to school for the Halloween/ Harvest Fest Parade (she's in 6th grade).  The head mask is attached to the whole outfit, so when she wore it to school (she wore it all day), she had to keep the mask down until the parade-time.  When it's down, it falls in front of her head, rather than in the back (like a hoodie) like we expected.  But she didn't mind at all.  Also, it is all one-piece, so I have no idea how the whole restroom-thing went!  It must have been fine b/c I didn't ask and she didn't volunteer anything!

  Plastic zipper so cheap it wouldn't even go up once before it broke.  Not only the zipper itself but the zipper pull literally broke into two pieces.  No way I can even fix it.  This specifically says its a mens costume.  Its one piece from toe to finger to attached hood/ mask.  My son is 5'4"" and it was tight from bottom to top.  He's 120 lbs with a 28"" waist (skinny as a rail) and was skin tight but I suppose that's that it should be.  But height wise I wouldn't put someone more than 5'2"" in it.  Left absolutely nothing to the imagination in terms of what was under it.  This was a size medium which was supposed to be a 42"" chest.  Absolutely would not fit a man with more than a 34"" chest.  My son has a normal size head and this was tight.  Not even sure it would have zipped around his head.  As zipper was broken we never got that far.But we were willing to put up with it being tight in every way.  The zipper makes it unusable.  For the price I'm stunned.  The fabric quality was OK.  About what you expect in a retail store Halloween costume, its not meant to be used more than a few times.  Design was good.  One piece with appropriate coloring in right places.  Feet, gloves and hood/ mask all attached which is  a plus or minus depending on your preference.  Size wise a foolish design because not everyone is the same height.Returning to Amazon.  Never returned a thing to Amazon before.  This clearly not Amazon fault.  Arrived in perfect condition, unopened.

  I bought the medium size and I am 6'1"" 185 lbs and it fits a little snug according to the sizing chart. The color is great and there is a spider graphic on the back. I may have been better off with the large, but it will work out.  I am breaking it in as it does need to stretch a little bit.  The zipper is not the strongest and the teeth do not lock together too well so you have to make sure you get it zipped all the way down the back of your head so the zipper does not separate. (My head might be a little large too) It is tough to get the costume zipped all the way up, but I used a wire hanger to hook the bottom zipper, grabbed the back of the costume to keep the zipper edges close together and pulled up.  Worked like a charm.  It is ok to see through, but I figured the vision would be a little blurry.  It gets tight around the ankles, again this should correct itself with a little wear.  The material is thin, but the seams are well constructed and tough.  I wouldn't yank on it too hard though.  No problems so far, then again, i have only had it for a day.  If there are any other issues, I will post to this review again.  If there are none, i will update this review after Halloween 2014.

  Heads up on the sizing: as listed on package, Medium fits 5'0"" -5'4"", large is 5'5"" to 5'10"", X-large is 5'11"" to 6'3"". I originally ordered the medium but sized up after reading the package. Whew.Now that that's out of the way, this is the suit you're looking for. Unbeatable price. Plus, it is all one piece which means no losing gloves or awkward sneaker wearing with the suit. Spider-man will be cohesively himself. The eyes are easy enough to see from, but my long eyelashes are just a little bothered by the mesh so close. Obviously this isn't the manufacturers fault. One complaint is the way the feet fit, they were made too tight over the front of the ankle and will have to be worn in for a while before fitting perfectly. Picture added soon.The feet have a thicker fabric on the sole, but not to the extent that i would wear outside for extended periods of time. A friend has glued soles from watershoes under the feet of his suit, and that seems like the best way to go about keeping the authentic spidey look with a bit more foot protection.I would recommend a light shirt under the suit, as well as compression shorts or running shorts, for comfort and modesty. Not really the most covering outfit. That said, all in all it is a strong recommendation from me.

  This is the best costume ever, a one piece lycra jumpsuit. It is so realistic and well made. I am a woman 5'8"", 32 inch waist, men's size 7 shoe, very athletic build. I went with s medium not a large like the package recommended and it fit great, very stretchy and could fit someone a bit larger. The only thing big on me was the feet which could probably fit up to a 9 shoe and the crotch since it is made for men. The hooded mask was just right with not much room left. It is skin tight so if you don't people to see your imperfections you might not like it. The only thing you might need to do is reinforce the feet. You could stand around indoors ok but if you are walking outside or jumping around they will rip. I bought a small tube of shoe goo and spread a good layer on them which was perfect. Also threw some insoles from my sneakers in them which was so comfortable and you couldn't  see them at all. Won best costume. I have been a collector of spiderman costumes and this is hands down the best one by a mile! I spent more on lunch than this costume!

  Im 5'8"", 145lbs, and it fit like a charm. Wore it to an anime convention for about three hours before changing out of it. During which I had to use the zipper several times to use the bathroom, eat, so on and so forth. At the end of the 3 hours I removed the suit completely and in doing so the zipper came right off. Later i was able to reattach it but for the price paid for this product I don't feel it should be a ""one use only"" type of deal.Aside from this minor qualm it was a major success and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and easy costume/cosplay.

  Perhaps one of the best costumes I've purchases on amazon ever.disclaimers:1. size is everything. I got a medium so it would be tight. it was. like ZERO room for error. I am 5'11"", athletic build, 30""-31"" waist, 175, and i have broad shoulders for my size. If you can pull this costume off (thank you TRX every day and rock climbing), do it.2. beware kids. even at a superhero gathering, kids actually thought I was Spiderman. (it's that good).3. the seams are what you'd expect, but I was still able to climb a rock wall, jump  over a ball pit barrier, and dance. try it on a few times, you will notice where the seams will start to pull if you have it ""properly"" tight. then just sew. there is an oddly placed one inch seam below the zipper and just over your tailbone. maybe to give room when you sit down (like in a car.... TEST THIS FIRST before going to your holiday party!). one little safety pin will do.4. the feet are narrow for the height of the costume. I wear an 11-12 and often wide. that is the MOST this can fit.5. roll this costume up slowly, getting every last bit of stretch out of it as you put it on. you will thank me. without this procedure, it didn't reach the (top of my inseam) and left a space, WITH this procedure, perfect fit and right to the top of my inseam.6. the zippers. if you have ANY chest or back to speak of, the zipper requires a friends help OR get a key chain necklace with a hook on one end and use that to pull it up. once it's on, it's easy to pull it down to the neck and show your head. but the costume is pretty good if you want to stay incognito.7. shockingly not too warm and not cold. like second skin. wore outside at first party til 9-10 PM (San Francisco) and inside at a hot club til closing. no issues.

  Mine arrived today and I've only worn it once but I LOVE it. I'm about 5'7 & 155lb and I bought the Medium. It is literally a 2nd skin. Good thing is that it is very breathable! I never felt suffocated.I gave it 4 stars because It fits almost perfectly. The fingers look short but feel fine. The red on the torso is long and the tip at the bottom of the belt is below my waist. (It actually lines up with my bulge, so it looks like its pointing at my crotch). Also, the face mask is very tight. The material presses against my eyes. (I have a flat nose, which probably doesnt help). I'm going to see if i can find a face mask/plate to wear underneath the mask. Also, minor nitpick-- the webbing on the costume does not line up perfectly along the seams. (I.e. the side of the mask).Regardless of the flaws, i love it and may even buy their Amazing Spider-man 2 costume. I definitely recommend this suit!

  The item is listed and manufactured as adult sizes, but I couldn't disagree more. I am a thin 5'2 female and found the size Medium for men's to be short and tight. The ankles and mask are so tight they feel like I'm having my circulation cut off. The good news is that the material was better than expected and is flexible enough to be in at reasonable and considerable movement. I would absolutely not recommend this for adults unless ordering 2-3 sizes up. This is fitted for kids and preteens however. My personal belief as well is that this costume is a tad overpriced. Other than that, it works to use for a couple times at conventions like I have used it.

  Seems cool. I'm about 5' 8"" athletic build, and it was baggy in the forearms. You have to have giant forearms or wrists to fill in this part of the costume. Fits a bit big. If you're a lot bigger or got meat on you, medium will fit and stretch on you to give you the full spiderman look. If you're any smaller, it'll be too big. Btw I tried it on for sizing only, before so there was a spot on the costume that has no color. No it's not ripped or anything. Must return it. Not sure if I want to order again. Careful about the quality and inspect it!

  SIZE MEDIUM  says fits up to size 5'4  My son is always a medium so I ordered this before seeing the 5'4 limit.  My son is 5'9 and 150 pounds and it fit pretty well except in the ankles it was really tight. He wears a size 10 shoe so the material is stretched at the ankle. However, other peoples reviews had 5'9 and 160 pounds fitting really well, and with some wear it stretches and gives a bit so we are hoping it will do just that.This is an amazing costume. It looks great on. Hope this helps.

  It is the perfect full Spiderman costume. Has a zipper back, not the velcro which snags. Love the zipper. However, it was too short. My child is 5'2 and we ordered a medium. It was too short to pull on without stretching the red to look faded. It was returned and a large was ordered. It also has texture on the bottom of the feet  but we use duct tape ,so the material won't rip from walking on pavement.

  This costume is fantastic, I have to say. It wears well, and it does so for a good price. I was initially skeptical of buying this costume when originally shopping for a good Spider-Man costume. So, I read the reviews, weighed the pros and the cons, and looked at customer photographs before deciding to go for it. I have not been disappointed.I originally ordered this costume in, I think, October of 2016. Now, a year later, I am still enjoying the costume. I wore it to the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere, and fans and friends alike enjoyed it! I also more recently wore it to a local community center play day for the kids. They enjoyed it immensely. And, as it comes to kids, I found myself doing all kinds of acrobatic things. I did hand stands, cartwheels, splits, and plenty of running around, and the costume has held up. And, at the premiere, I jumped onto things and off things (within good reason), and never had any issues with the suit. Definitely a win-win.Now, as others have said, the costume does have a red mesh where the nose and mouth are. And if someone is up close and personal, they will possibly be able to see your mouth and nose. It does, however, making breathing a bit easier, and doesn't detract from the overall appearance of the costume. And if you were to stand a few feet back, you can hardly notice it. The mesh for the eyes isn't the easiest thing to see out of, but it's not exceedingly impossible. In the daytime, anyhow. At nighttime, I probably wouldn't really attempt to walk around with the mask zipped up without a bit of help. Overall, not a deal breaker.I should probably also add that wearing an undergarment beneath your costume is probably a very good idea. I've stuck with a pair of compression shorts that aren't really visible and work well with the suit.One last thing regarding size-- we're probably all wondering ""will it fit me""? Having ordered another super hero suit, I found that the other suit was appropriately slim-fitting, but still a touch baggy in the waist area. So, I went with a smaller size. As a guy who is 5'6.25"" and 122 lbs, and who generally falls more into the large size category for a suit like this, I bought a medium instead. The medium is appropriately snug, but still allows for plenty of movement, and fits a bit better than my other super hero costume.All in all, if you're looking for a cheaper cosplay outfit or something to wear for Halloween or to conventions or birthday parties and events, this is definitely worth a buy. Perhaps not so much if you're looking for absolute screen-accuracy, but it definitely feels like you're stepping right out of the comic books the moment you put it on. Of course, the brighter colors probably help with that, and wonderfully so!

  So here's the issue with the suit. I have a 16 year old son who is 5'9 and weighs 125 pounds. Tall and slender kid. He put the suit on all excited to wear it but it was really wonky. It was almost too tight length wise but the width was really wide. He looked like a flying squirrel in it. He was super bummed out.

  The fit was small. Bought a adult medium for a 10 year old who is 110 lbs. Costume fit but the attached mask must be made for someone with a shrunken head. We could not even put it on partially. Ended up getting a costume locally. Dont bother with this one.

  5'10, 130 lb woman here. The costume is much too short for my height, the ""crouch"" hits at half my thighs, and the attached ""mask"" barely contains my hair/ponytail. The costume is super fun overall, and with a little maneuvering these are all things you can overcome.I'll probably be returning for a longer size.

  Disappointed with photos provided on this product.  There was no way to gauge the sizing so I read reviews and selected a size Medium for 5’9 140 pounds.  The person playing the character showed up before party and the package showed 5’0-5’4 on the package, WHY was this not listed I would have known to get a bigger size.  We had to make do with what we had and it was such a bummer having to cut and pin the costume in real time and Spider-Man not being able to play with the kids because he could hardly walk 😭😭😭

  Received the product and it was not what we had expected. I ordered a men’s medium for my 9 year old. The material is very thin, any sudden movements will tear it. The head on the costume is way too small. I don’t know anyone with a tiny head and eyes at the top of their head like this costume has. I returned it. Not worth the money.

  I am 5'6 weigh 130 lbs with a skinny build. The size on here says that if you are over 5'4'' you must get a large, but I think getting that would make the suit sag on me. I wear glasses and obviously it pops out in the eye area especially if you wear thicker frames. Probably not good for photos! But even then, if you don't wear glasses, the eye area is just too hard to see and it can irritate your eyes.

  If you buy this, plan on only wearing it only a couple of times. So basically, t's perfect for a Halloween party or two but the fabric will soon get caught in the zipper. That'll happen a couple of times, and then very soon the zipper will just break. That being said, the costume fit and looked fine. It's a fun thing to have, but it won't last you long. If that's okay with you, buy it. Also, I'm 5'10"" about 150lbs and the Medium suit fit me fine.

  I would have given a 5 star rating, based on costume design,body fit and material.All  are great, but I was unable to get the costume to zip all the way up. The eyes and nose parts do not line up and there was no way to get the costume to zip all the way up. I took a Medium costume and the body was a good fit, still had some room so it was not fully fitted. Which makes the head portion unable to zip all the way up even more confusing.

  I read a few reviews before I purchased this but I havent ran into any issue as of yet. I did read about the zipper difficulty but just a little bit of effort and you'll get it all set. Or if you have someone to just zip the back but I was able to do it by myself. Med size fit me for a thin build 5'10 / 140lbs. Your eyes remain pretty well hidden in the white eyes of the suit. The mouth area is thinner, but not very visible either. I believe it says so you can drink through it. Overall good costume

  It looks incredible.  Fits a little bit small, so make sure you follow the size chart and maybe go over if you're in between sizes.  The zipper in the back is really difficult to get too with one person, so having assistance will get the thing on much quicker.  Once it's on though, you look identical to spiderman's original costume including the red spider on the back.  Oh, and it's a bit difficult to see out of, but not too bad.

  I ended up returning this because it was really small and it isn't really made for adult hands and feet. I really really wanted this costume to work for Halloween (2015) but alas it just fit awkwardly..I am 5'10 150 lbs and the medium was tight on me. I couldn't really fully zip up the back without worrying that I would tear it apart.The hands, as someone else had mentioned, had finger space of about two inches before the webbing started to go to the next finger...I don't know about you, but children are the only people I know with two inch fingers.The feet were really small. I don't have big feet for a guy...wear a men's size 9 and my feet are narrow, but I couldn't even squeeze my feet into them, once again, they felt like they were made for children.The packaging says recommended height of 5'3""I would avoid buying this unless you buy a size or two bigger, but even then you're going to have weird looking baby hands. The costume itself looked decent, the fit was just all wrong and not made for Americans.Review Disclaimer: I did not receive this product discounted nor was I asked to review it by the seller.

  I looked at a number of bee costumes on Amazon and this was one of the most expensive BUT reading the descriptions of the others, it looked like they were vinyl apron-like garments that tie off at the shoulders. This one is a fabric (though a very cheap knitted fabric) shirt/tunic made to be worn over a long-sleeved shirt.  It also comes with the leggings, a nice touch. It is VERY roomy!  I am 5'8"" tall & 175 lbs and it is very large on me, though not a problem because I didn't get it to look sexy.  I would have given it 5 stars, except the headband with the antennae is very poorly put together & guaranteed to break before the Halloween party is over. One of the antennae was detached before I even got it out of the package. I didn't send it back because I was able to reinforce it adequately with a black pipe cleaner. So - 1 star for poor antenna design/quality control. I completed the costume with a pair of the bee-eyes glasses, a black long-sleeved T shirt, and a pair of black leggings.

  For the price, I'm not quite happy. One antenna's yellow fluffy circle is broken upon arrival. I ordered a bigger one expecting to be comfortable, and the body cover is... but the leg warmers are tight on my arms and will not go on my legs, they're quite small and not very stretchable. The wings attach with Velcro. If this is the only thing in this size you can find, then so be it. But it left much to be desired. I'd return it but I didn't keep the packaging.

  I was worried that the quality of this costumer might not be too great, but with the free return shipping I figured I would give it a go. When it came in I was very happy with the quality! It isn't see through, the wings stick to the costume very well with velcro. The velcro was a very nice touch so that I didn't have to wear the elastic that cuts into your arm pits. I wore this costumer for two events and the wings were taken on and off several times with no issue with the velcro. The leg warmers were perfect and stretchy if you have bigger calves. The headband was comfortable too. I wish they were bendy so they didn't stand up straight, but they were cute non the less!

  I am 3 months post partum and was not looking forward to Halloween due to the limited womens costumes that would accommodate my body. I LOVE this costume. It is versatile, comfortable, oddly flattering. I wore with leggings and it was perfect.I am 5'7"" and 200#.**add on** - The leg warmers FIT! I have large calves and require to buy xwide calf boots. These slip on with ease and stay on! I am over the moon happy with these!!!The scrunch on the bottom allows you to make it more sexy and get closer to your butt, or make it longer for more of a conservative attire (good for work). Highly recommending.One problem, the antenna came broken, but its nothing to complain about, removed one start because of that.

  Giving two stars because it was so cheap I should have known it wouldn't be great... First of all, the headband came broken (one antenna was completely detached from the band with no good way to fix it), and second of all it is wildly unflattering. The model looked cute in it, but it really just fits like a huge trash bag with holes in it for your arms and head. You definitely are getting what you pay for with this. It is not the worst thing ever, it just isn't great. I could forgive it a bit if the headband wasn't broken.

I ordered the plus sized and its a big big, but thats what I was hoping for. It is easy to put on, easy to wear and super cute. well, not a hot costume, and breathable material makes it easy to layer. The wings are a bit flimsy where they attach but thats an easy fix. 10/10.

  The costume arrived on time and in good condition and looked exactly like the picture. I wore a long sleeve black t-shirt and black leggings under it, and used the leg warmers on my arms, as they were too small to wear on my legs. (I bought some yellow ribbon to pin around my leggings to create stripes on my legs.) At a Halloween party at work, it was voted the best costume. When I wore it to hand out candy on Halloween night,  little kids were thrilled (""Mom, a bumblebee gave me candy!"") and their parents laughed. I'm 5'2"" and it was plenty roomy and comfortable, even when sitting in a chair at my office. Surprisingly, even though it's large it made me look slimmer, which is great!  A couple of friends borrowed the costume for parties - one is about 5 feet tall and probably 180 pounds; the other is about 5'7"" and a bit over 200 pounds, and it fit both of them fine.  Definitely a good buy. (Also - It easily packs up in a small box, and doesn't take up much room in the closet, which is nice.)

  I bought this and it was just as the good reviews said it would be. Fit well, looked good, was comfortable, nicer material than the cheaper ones. The headband was intact. there was nothing wrong with it. I got a larger size because the Halloween party was outside so I wore layers under it. I put the large bubble wrap around the bottom which made it stand out and look good. I was very pleased.

  The quality is typical of most costumes you'd find in the store.  The tunic is thin, but adequate.  I generally wear XL, but ordered the 2XL, and it is quite roomy.

  I have mixed feelings about this costume. First, it did run a little smaller but I anticipated that so that wasn't a big deal but this thing shed like crazy. It shed so much that it does say you shouldn't wash it, thankfully it was a one time use situation. I also didn't leave my baby in it too long because of the shedding, I didn't want him to get itchy. When it was on it was very cute, I just wish it was better quality.

  Oh so close! I thought for sure I'd be giving 5 perfect  reviews. The shirt arrived today and where the Womens costume was perfect, the shirt was a little large on my guy. Worse than that was that it was only the shirt and not the full costume. It is listed as a costume. Perhaps I overlooked the details but considering it cost more than the full women's costume, we assumed....lesson learned.Luckily the party isn't until this Saturday and I can scurry to find pants. I attempted to order them but even with Prime, I won't get them in time.

  The product description is misleading because it’s a how’s the pants but they are not part of the package.  The women’s version is the same price but because it’s one piece it includes the pants.  The kicker is that if you want the pants , Amazon sells it at an inflated price because they have software that has tracked your purchases.  Therefore you now have to pay a very inflated price to finish the costume.  All purchasing options are outrageously priced.

  My son received many compliments and requests for pictures when he wore the costume for Halloween. The fabric for the costume doesn't have that ""costume"" texture or appearance.

He had a wonderful time showcasing this costume over the Halloween weekend so this item is considered a huge success. I highly recommend it!

  I absolutely love this costume! Cannot wait to wear it for Fantasy Fest this year. However I rated this 4 stars because my package was missing 4 items (arm cuffs, headpiece and necklace.) I have contacted the seller to send me the missing items.UPDATE to 5 Stars: Seller responded quickly and assured me the replacement items would be sent. I received the package and not only did I receive the missing items... I received the whole costume again! Now I own two which is actually perfect for my roommate to wear. Thanks Dreamgirl... or shall I say Dreamguy? ;)Now for the costume: I'm really only wearing the skirt, headpiece and cape. I like the costume better without the shirt so I won't be wearing it. The arm cuffs are too big (expected this, I have small wrists) so I ordered gold metal bracelets to replace. The necklace is very cheap, basically just a triangle of fabric glued to a string. I ordered a real metal necklace with the eye or horus to really make it stand out. Lastly I ordered similar gold gladiator sandals to complete the look! All in all I really like this costume and the fabric is really soft. Price could be cheaper, but all costumes are expensive.

  This looked GREAT in the photo.  Quality wasnt too bad (except the cheesy ""necklace) but it didnt look good on me.  I'm middle aged and a bit heavy.  I saw a picture of an older guy wearing it and he looked pretty good so I thought I would try it.  The headpiece just lies over the top of your head.  I felt like it needed to come up just a bit before going over and back.  Plus the ""skirt"" was way to big.  I could have pinned it if I had liked how the outfit had looked.Unfortunately, I tried on the top and bottom to see what the fit was like as soon as I got it but I didnt put the whole outfit on.  This meant, as I was getting ready to go to the party, I realized I didnt like how it looked on me and ended up having to return AFTER Halloween instead of before.  I knew they would think I was just trying to get a ""free"" Halloween outfit but at this price, I decided to do it anyway.  I have to say, they did accept the return, that's why I gave 3 stars instead of 1.  It should be noted however that they charge about $5.50 for return postage.

  Costume is great fun, and I really enjoyed wearing it, but the necklace is cheap crap, you are much better off leaving it out, or buying/making a different necklace for the costume.Be aware it doesnt come with shoes.

  I read a lot of reviews and I am glad i went with a Medium.  I am 6ft about 190lbs and it fits great.  the skirt part has elastic so its fine.  Without it, it would still be a little big.  the medallion is cloth and its garbage, throw it away.  Get either a nice plastic one or a cheap metal one like I did off Amazon.  The only complaint i have is that the cape is attached to the color and due to its weight it pulls the collar so it rides against my neck. But its not bad, just a little annoying.  I might look at a way to pin the collar to my shirt to stop this but then you cant remove the cape.  Overall its made well, looks great, and was priced right!

  I know I'm posting this after Halloween but I still like to review things and there's always next year, or costume parties....or dress up time. I had intended for my newly turned 2 year old to be something else but he saw his big brother in a Catboy costume and got super excited. His brother suggested he be Gecko and he started jumping around shouting ""Gecko!"". So I bought him a second costume! He LOVED it from moment 1. We live in the North so it has to go over clothes for Trick or Treating. The fit was pretty spot on for him but he's not large for his age at all. If your child is a larger 2 year old you might want to size up. It's thin but the material makes it fairly warm still. The removable tail is a nice feature. We got SO many compliments on how cute our little guy looked in this though he kept tripping in it, I blame the mask. But he was having so much fun we didn't take it off. The CUTEST part of this costume with a little guy is the tail wiggling back and forth as they walk/run. I actually took a video of just him from behind and everyone thought it was the best Halloween video they'd seen bc it was super cute and different from actually seeing the kids faces, haha. I plan on letting my boys play with their costumes as long as they fit in them, should be perfect on snow days if we are inside.

  Best investment I’ve made all year! The best costume for your Pj mask lover! It is a very thin material but don’t overlook that. This is the one time your going to want it! My toddler plays until he passes out which usually ends up with him getting so hot and sweaty he has a melt down and strips off his clothes! But this costume is so light and breathable he can wear it all day. I have to basically spray him down with a hose he loves it so much and refuses to take it off! It’s been around 6 months so he has now outgrown it and it has become tattered but I will definitely repurchase!!!

  This runs quite small. I was very disappointed when I opened this to put it on my son only to find it was too small! My so. Is two and is small for his age. He still wears 18-24 month clothes and is not yet in 2T. I thought this would fit him well. It is tight and about an inch and a half too short in the arms and legs.  The next size up is a 3t/4t combo which is much too big. Very disappointed. The quality is fine but irrelevant as I ordered this over a month ago and we cannot exchange or return and it is to small to wear.

  This costume came exactly as expected.

The mask is slightly big as expected but it will work for Halloween! I think we should be able to adjust it. Also love that the tail is detachable because I was worried it would get ripped off anyway! Cannot wait for Halloween to come already!

  I bought all three PJ masks costumes for my kids and niece for Halloween. They are made well enough for a costume. The kids are still playing in them a couple weeks later and they are still holding up. Sizes were spot on. My only complaint is that you have to remove the entire costume for a potty break but that is probably the case with mist kids costumes.

  This is an adorable costume. My 2 year old is small for his age, so I thought this would be big enough to wear over clothes for Halloween night. But, it's smaller than I expected and it fits him perfectly by itself.This seems to be good quality. He's only worn it for 5 minutes so far so it's still in good condition for trick-or-treating. The tail is attached with Velcro.His sister is going as Catboy and they are absolutely adorable in these costumes.

  Not very well made. The Velcro straps in the back constantly catch onto the costume itself, and tears the fabric. The masks are also huge. I bought two sizes, 2t and 5t since both my kids want to be Gekko. The size 2 mask fit my big headed 4 year old perfectly, while the size 5 mask was a perfect match for my husband.

   I am not sure why the only bad review for this says that it is bad quality. I was disappointed that for the price it didn’t even include some really cheap boxing gloves, because those are expensive elsewhere. The fabric is actually good quality; very stretchy, no loose threads, and the fabric is extremely breathable. The shorts on the model look like mini shorts, but the shorts on me actually fit like underwear. I would give it a 8/10.

  My son loves this costume!  It is so cool and will make for a very fun Halloween experience!  The only thing I wish was that it had a stronger fan.  It blows up the whole dinosaur but the head does stay a bit floppy due to the lower air pressure but when he wears the strap around the neck it does hold the head up better.

  It is outstanding, and more fun than you can imagine possible with a costume.  It seems durable and still seems as good as new after two full days of use.  The fan works well to keep the costume inflated, and it serves the dual purpose of keeping you nice and cool so that you do not sweat from wearing a costume.  It fits well even though I am 6' 3"".  I would recommend this to anyone.  I thought it was overpriced until it came and I saw how well it was made.

  I was very disappointed with this purchase. The location and output of the fan did not meet my expectations. The fan is very high in the waist causing the air output to be restricted making the head of the Raptor almost floppy the whole night. Also within the first night of use the material tore where the neck and waist meet. As far as the look of the inflatable it was ok. Looked like the photos but unfortunately it did not even make it one night. Considering contacting the company for a refund.

  Noticed the eyes didn't light up.  Looks like someone crossed the wires in assembly.  The usb cord goes into the fan unit and there are two wires coming from there that get hooked into the wires coming to the light up eyes with crimp ""butt"" connecters.  I saw voltage on the connectors so pulled the wires out and reversed, like magic the eyes worked..  Would have gotten a 5 star if I didn't have to rewire it.  Space left in the connectors so I was able to shove the wires in and compress those so I didn't have to use new ones.  Hilarious costume, everything else was on point.

  When I saw this costume on Amazon, I just knew that I had to have it for Halloween even though it was only May. Over the years, I have a hard time finding costumes that I like and this one just hit the mark. It is creative and fun not just for the wearer, but for others too. So far, my family has gotten a good laugh and gives the wearer an opportunity to have fun acting out quick alien abduction scenes. I can't wait until Halloween to entertain party-goers and trick or treaters. I'm 5'11"" and 180 lbs and it fits well. One more thing, I like the fact that it is open-faced for the wearer. It gives me an opportunity to wear a creative costume yet eliminated the need to use a mask or makeup. So it is a clean and comfortable walk away at the end of the night. Also, the open face does not inhibit eating or drinking at the party which has always been a negative in wearing a mask. It came packaged new and just like an item you would buy at a big box Halloween store.

  I was the last alien in a line of 7 at a bluegrass music festival. We decided to walk up the path to main stage in a single file line and I have never laughed so hard in my life!!! It was July and hot so at first the constant air flow around your body which exits around you neck, ankles and wrists was quite nice but 30 minutes into us dancing and parading around the thing is just circulating hot air and now hot air is blowing out around your neck and face. Now I am still laughing at the entire scene when I realize the legs of my costume (which is like a parachute material) is now sticking to my sweaty legs and forcing me to waddle!!! WADDLE! Now I'm dieing of laughter! We make as quick of a run as was physically possible to get back to camp to get these things off that now feel our own personal saunas! I highly recommend them! We had a blast and were stopped several times for photos! The only other downside is sometimes the battery packs and fan/air intake fall off but after a quick snap back together they kept working! #campmotherfuckinfuckyeah

  Every year at the school carnival I wear a different inflatable costume. This one is great. It's fun and unlike other inflatable costumes this one is easy to walk in (you don't have to take little stutter steps). I am 6'3"" and 240 lbs. Though I am at the limits size wise of this costume (mainly the sleeves are a little short) it still fits comfortably. By the way I ordered the adult large.

  I took a chance and got the adult size of this costume for my 5 foot-tall 12 year-old.  It was a good call as it fits very well other than the legs getting bunched up at his ankles…  But that’s easily solved.  The rest of it, the arms, and the torso are a perfect fit.There is a little fan at the waist that is powered by 4 AA batteries.  The fan fills up the costume by blowing air into it, and there are elastic cuffs at the ankles, wrists, and neck.  One cool thing is that the fan has a USB (A) connector, so if you’re out of batteries or need something that will last a long time, you can connect it to a rechargeable battery pack because of the USB connection.  I tested that and it worked.

  There are only two sizes available, and my 11 year old son is too big for the child size, but way too short for the adult size. We originally ordered the child size, and then returned it for the adult size, but it’s so tall it flops around and he’s not sure he wants to use it anymore. Other than that, it works perfectly, just wish there was a middle size.

  The fan was stronger in this than the other inflatable I ordered (different shape, unicorn riding princess) fan is easy to replace /remove too so I can interchange it with my other costume to inflate it more fully. I wish there was an easy way to make these “blue jeans” look more believable without making it too heavy to inflate. Used for a party. Will probably reuse at Halloween time as is durable and doesn’t take up to much space deflated.

  This is such an awesome costume!! Of course as soon as we got it, we had to take it out and try it on. I loved it, my kid loves it for Halloween. My kiddo is a little under 5' and we got the adult size one and works fine. Just need to do what the reviews mentioned about the battery pack. Thanks for the reviews, it helped a lot in making this purchase. We are very happy and excited to use it next month for a few things.

  This costume is the best.  I wore it to three different parties and functions this weekend alone. Everyone loved it and thought it was the best.  I completely shadowed my wife's costume as well (see pic).One item of note, I preferred my arms under the aliens arms for 2 reasons.  1, it was easier for me to rest my arms against my own body and 2, if I put my arms over top the aliens, it made the alien arms bend more outwards making it appear to not hold me and it cut off air flow supply so the lower part of the arms deflated a bit.

  I absolutely loved wearing this costume.  It's hilarious and makes everyone laugh.  I'm a plus sized short girl, and it fit me fine.  It's a little hard to put on and get the fan running on your own, so it's better to have someone to help you with it.  I wore it for about two hours and the batteries stayed strong.  I plan on wearing this many times, as it seems very well made to do so.  I don't see it being very warm on a cold Halloween, however.  I had a fleece lined shirt and fleece lined leggings on, and was decently warm on a 58 degree fall day.

  This is a classic costume. It is pretty funny and a great idea. Though, the costume does feel a little cheap for the cost of it. The material feels cheap and thin. I was worried about popping the costume if it comes in contract with a sharp object. No accidents have occurred but it seems like it could easily happen to anyone walking around. They costume is also not breathable. If you live in a hot place like myself it may not be the best choice because you will most likely sweat and be uncomfortable. Other than that it is a good costume if you are careful.

  I must have received a dud because I did exactly as the instructions said: put in 4 brand new AA batteries, put the screw back, connected it to the suit, and put the suit on and the fan blows barely any air. It won’t fill up the suit. So I used my blow dryer to “help” and then it blew up but the fan still wasn’t powerful enough to keep it inflated. Lame.... I was really excited for this costume.

  I do not recommend this product. The zipper jammed the first time I tried to put it on. When I got it unstuck, it separated below the slide and I could not reconnect it. Also, the fan seems under-powered for keeping the costume firmly inflated, but I could not confirm that because the costume never closed correctly to begin with. Beware of a very low price, the quality is commensurate to that.  I returned this item the day after it arrived.

  The only reason I'm giving this costume a 1 star rating is because when it came in, it was missing a vial part of it. It was missing the ring to go on the outside to hold the fan in.  Thankfully, we bought a costume a few years ago that blew up like this one that had the ring with it. So we used that one instead. We were so happy that it fit this costume.

  We've really enjoyed this costume. It would have gotten 5 stars but the neck is super tight and it seems that there should be a way to make it comfortable while still being adjustable. But yes.. we ordered one to play with during covid... because you know we need as many ways as possible to entertain ourselves.  Since then, we've ordered several more inflatable costumes. By far, this one gets the biggest reaction, (we’ve bout 3) however it is pretty uncomfortable for the long haul and heats up easily... which could be really helpful in the winter. It just wasn’t the best in 105° temperatures. Go figure. 😂😂😂

  I read a lot of reviews trying to figure out the right size to order, so hopefully this will help others. I'm 5'9"", 180 (+/-) lbs, athletic build, typically wear M slim-fit shirts, 33x30 pants. The S/M was the right size for me. Sleeves were just a little shorter than I would have liked (maybe another 1/2""-1"") and the legs were a bit long (2""), but with boots, it wasn't really that obvious. The overall fit was good. It was just a little tight when fully zipped and getting on/off - once you step in, getting the arms took a little twisting. The front has a double zipper so when zipped up with the top zipper, you can also zip up from the bottom when nature calls.The costume itself is great - good quality, many zipper pockets (2 chest pockets, 1 upper right thigh, 2 lower leg) and front/arm patches. As noted, there are both Maverick and Goose velcro patches. As others have noted, the bottom of the legs have zippers so I don't think there is a (easy) way to hem the legs if needed. There are also velcro bands on each wrist and both sides of the waist, to tighten as needed.Add a pair of sunglasses and dog tags (bought on Amazon) and you're all set!I also bought the M/L since I wasn't sure which size would fit. I didn't even bother trying it on, the legs would have been comically long.

  ..I am 6'2 250 so I figured to be safe and order an extra large..this thing is huge with room to spare. The quality seems good for something in this price range and it looks good. I threw it in the wash because it smelled like its been on a shelf for a while, other than that it will need to be ironed, but this is a good buy! Update!!! I washed it on easy cold/cold and dried it low heat and it now fits perfectly!!!

  Really upset. This says I’m buying the Leg Avenue men’s flight suit, but I was sent a different brad. It came in “standard” size, did not have the name tag patches and came with cheap sunglasses instead. I would like to send it back and get what I actually ordered but I’m afraid I’ll just get the same costume back. Would love for someone from the company to reach out to me.

  My wife and I each ordered one of these. I am 6’3”, 210lbs and I ordered a M/L. For me the fit was pretty true to size, a little on the short size, the sleeves about 4 inches too short, and a bit tight in the shoulders, but it will work. My wife is 5’5” and 125lbs and she ordered a S/M. It was way too long for her in the arms and legs. For some reason the torso for the M/L and S/M are the same length, so the bottom of the torso sat at her knees. We could hem the arms and legs, but this was a deal breaker. Unfortunately, we will have to return hers. It was a good thing we did order two of them though, because mine came with two Maverick patches and hers came with a Goose and Maverick patch so we were able to correct the patches for mine. Hopefully she can find something that will work for her. We would order an XS, but the size chart indicates that it would be too small for her and I’m guessing the torso would be just as long.

  To start with, I'm not huge on dressing up for Halloween, but my roommates decided to throw a huge Halloween party so I kind of had to. I'm a huge fan of Top Gun, so I decided that I'd dress up as Maverick. I looked all over the internet for a costume, and stumbled upon this one. It seemed like a pretty good product, and I was correct. This costume is pretty awesome and feels really legit. I do like the interchangable name tags, so one person can be goose and the other Maverick.I'm about 5'10"" and 190lbs. It was a little tight around the back, so don't plan on doing any physical activities with it. It did get a little hot, but I live in North Carolina, so keep that in mind. Overall, it was a great costume for a night of drinking.

  This is a great suit and I’m very happy I bought it. It is real cotton fabric, albeit somewhat thin material. The patches are very good quality and you get both Maverick and Goose name patches to pick from. My one complaint is the legs are too long by a lot (8-10 inches). I had to roll them up because they went well past my shoes. Of note, I am a 5’ 7” woman 225 lbs and carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs and the suit fit me comfortably, even loose. I can see how if someone has a long torso it might be a constricting fit as the torso was just about right on me. Overall, I recommend it and with good care you’ll be able to reuse this suit many times.

  We ordered two M/L suits for a Maverick/Goose couples costume. I am a woman, am 5'2, and 165. The suit is too long but I tried the waist straps around the back to pull the length up and snug it around my waist. My bf is 5'11 and about 185. His fits perfectly. Fabric is thin, but perfect for an indoor event or you could layer to keep warm. The patches are interchangeable between Goose and Maverick. Hope this helps!

  The suit is decent quality and looks good when worn, but it only fits if you are close to ""average"" height.  I am 6'5"" and originally ordered an XL, which was too short (thought plenty wide).  I then tried a 2XL, which was wider, but no taller... so if you're a tall person like me, even larger sizes won't work for you.

  Great costume. Overall the quality is great and the fit is generally good. I'm 5'11"" and it is just a tad short in the torso, meaning if I lift my arms, it starts to rise up in sensitive areas but otherwise no problem. The only improvement I could note is that the zippers could be a bit better. They tend to catch the excess fabric if you zip them quickly.

  This is possibly the best costume I've ever purchased. Most costumes are single-use quality, but the quality of this is fantastic. The detail & patches are authentic and I also bought the Pete Mitchell/Maverick dog tags to go with my costume. I threw on my aviators and went to an 80's themes birthday party where there was Marty McFly, Andre Agassi, Axl Rose, and dozens of other stars of the 80's....and I won the costume contest with this! I hung it in the closet and will definitely be using it again in the future. This is the only costume I have ever fully recommended, which says a lot because I'm picky about quality and being a Top Gun fan, I'm a stickler for details...and this was worth the $$!I'm 6ft, 224lbs and the Medium/Large fit well...especially the arm & leg lengths. The crotch area was a bit snug and bending over/sitting down wasn't really possible, but it was never really ""uncomfortable"".

  I bought myself this outfit and my fiancé the male outfit and boy did we look good!! I was so satisfied!! We added shotgun ammo belts to add a bit of a more military look to it and I made sure we wore Aviator Sunglasses. We got so many compliments and his sister even said she'd probably want to borrow our outfits for next years Halloween! Some kid at the grocery store thought I was an actual fighter pilot and went and told his dad hahaha. Anyways, the only thing I didn't like was the sewing in the middle going down toward the crotch. The thread came out a little bit BUT didn't cause anything to unhem all the way or anything. I have a smaller torso and am petite so I had to pull the leg part down and made it JUST a little baggy so that it would look good on the top. Again, my fiancé and I were super satisfied. I wish I could wear it all the time lol. But we have to earn our badges the right way! (:

  For what it is, I thought it was really good - but based on other reviews here, I bought the XL (I'm 6'1"" and about 210 lbs).  It's HUGE - really long and baggy in the legs especially.  I think I'm just in between sizes, but if you're smaller than I am, go with the M/L (which my brother in law got).  He's 5'10"" and around 175 lbs and it fit perfectly.  Otherwise, it's a fun costume that comes with both the ""Maverick"" and ""Goose"" patches (which attach with velcro).

  I gave this 4 stars because as a 6"" tall man (The absolute shortest height I would recommend for a X-Large) it still rode up in the crotch area while being long on the legs (could be I have a long torso, but I'm pretty average build).

  I've used this costume for the past two Halloweens. Looks great and it's held up quite well. It's also a really comfortable costume to wear to work for our annual costume day. Nice that you can be Goose or Maverick.That being said, it's a little bit short in the groin area. I'm 5'9"" 190 lbs, and it fits well, but I have to crouch a little when putting it on. Anyone taller than 5'10"" might have more trouble.Also, it's kinda difficult to use the restroom while wearing it. You have to unzip the whole costume, but it's not a deal-breaker.

I am 6 ft, 260 lbs. and while I feel the suit fit well everywhere else it was unbearable due to the fact that my butt had to eat the crotch of the pants to get it on.  It got me a good laugh from my wife but there was no possibility of wearing it.  I have returned it for the 3X.

  For a costume, this one is well made. The fabric is a decent weight and despite the washing instructions, weathered a machine wash and hang dry very well. I especially like that it came with interchangeable Goose and Maverick patches. The women's version of this costume has the same feature and gave me and my husband the ability to not be the same person (but really... who wants to be Goose?).The medium/large we ordered allowed my husband to wear jeans and a tshirt underneath, but it would definitely work fine without jeans under.

  This is by far the best costume I've worn out of any Halloween (except when I used to be a Power Ranger as a child of course). I was surprised at how durable the fabric seemed. Also, if you're anywhere where it usually gets cold, this is a great costume because the fabric is relatively thick and will keep you a comfortable kind of warm. Finally, the costume has a total of 3 pockets, which is great if you're carrying your usual gear (phone, wallet, etc.). Also, it has two zippers running up and down in the middle, which allows us to use the bathroom (urinating at least) very easily.This is a fantastic costume.

  This costume is decent for the price.  The material is a bit thin so my husband wore thin pajamas underneath it.  It's a bit big, but it is somewhat adjustable.

  After reading many of the reviews on this costume I decided to go with the medium/large size. As with many others when putting this on, it does fit a bit tight in the crotch, but this can be fixed a bit once fully on by pulling down on the suit a bit. I'm 5' 11"" 205lbs and with a 44"" chest, 32"" inseam and 36"" waist. To me, it fit pretty darn perfect, though you may need a hand in getting out of it, as it is a bit snug and form fitting! I can tell you that the women at our Halloween party really loved the effect. You can't pull this costume off with a beer gut, so spare yourself  and go another route. Costume is fairly well made as others have also noted. I took off a star as others have pointed out that this were NO aviator sun glasses included with costume. Apparently this costume once included a pair, but alas no longer! Online wording saying 2 Piece needs to be changed, as it's only one piece, just the suit itself is in the package. Included are two velcro attached separate name patches. One for Maverick and the other for Goose. Honestly, I don't know who the heck would want to be the guy who ends up dead from a broken neck. The other name tag should be for Iceman. I ended up making my own Iceman name tag from the Goose one which I would never have used anyway. I blacked out the red lettering and then stick-on letters I bought at a hobby shop. It came out great. All other patches are well sewn on. Not certain what costume others are talking about saying they weren't properly attached as mine couldn't have been put on any better. Price on Amazon is much better than you'd pay at Party City as well.

  I ordered two of these for my husband and I to wear together, SM/MD for me and MD/LG for him.

  Got a lot of compliments on this. The patches look legit, zippers are stout, and all pockets are real. Really high quality for a costume. I could absolutely see someone using it as coveralls for working on the car or whatever after its time as a costume was over.My only complaint is that the fit is a little off. I'm tall at 6'4 and while the overall length was fine, it's pretty tight in the crotch. Someone with a long torso would not fit into this comfortably.

Plenty of room in the waist,  (the waist size chart is not accurate...luckily), a bit tight in the crotch, the arms are an inch or 2 shorter than I would of liked, but the legs are long enough so I'm happy.

  From a quality standpoint, the flight suit is surprisingly good, especially for a costume.  My only complaint is what others have noted -- the legs are simply too long.  In my case, I ordered a small-medium, and the the inseam measures 35 inches.  I can't imagine too many people ordering a S-M need an inseam that long.  And unfortunately from an alterations standpoint, the leg bottoms are finished with zippers, so it isn't just a simple matter of folding them up or hemming them.

  Costume was made well enough.  However, it is insanely large.  I'm 5'10' 190lbs, based on the size chart online I opted for the m/l just to be on the safe side but it's HUGE on me.  legs at least 6 inches long and the torso is baggy, belt velcros are too wide to make up the difference at the waist.  Going to wear pants underneath to fill in the legs and make what alterations I can on the torso and shoulders.  Would return for the s/m but I needed it right away.

  I ordered this for my husband for Halloween. He is going as Maverick and I bought the corresponding dog tags. It's a nice costume as far as fit and  quality goes (not amazing but not bad compared to many Halloween costume quality standards), but the product description as well as the bag it came in says it includes both Maverick and Goose name tags. Ours only came with Goose. We checked the bag and all the pockets multiple times. Annoying. I don't have time to send it back or order a new one since we have a party to go to in 2 days so I will have to go buy a Maverick tag at the local Halloween store.

  Fits great!  I read a lot of reviews before deciding on the S/M for myself, definitely do the same if you are inbetween sizes or have proportions that you know may be problematic.I am 5'9"" medium athletic build and my weight tends to fluctuate around 185 +/-5 lbs.  I generally wear M/L in men's sizes, with M fitting on the tighter end, L being a bit looser.  15.5"" neck 34"" arm length.  34"" waist, 30"" inseam.  40-42R jacket and sports jersey size.  This should give you a really good idea of measurements and adjust for yourself.The S/M is almost perfect for me, the length/height is just right, however, the shoulders felt a little bit tight (I've always had wider shoulders for my build).  The waist and chest were perfect maybe a bit on the tight side but anyone lighter than 180lbs should feel very comfortable.  Taller slimmer men might be OK in this suit as well, but taller than 5'11"" you may be looking at a nuthugging/highwater situation.  The M/L however would probably end up really baggy.  Overally I'm extremely pleased with how the S/M fits me, I just need to do some crunches to get that gut into shape before Halloween!As for the suit itself, the quality and detail are outstanding.  While the patch and insignias are not exactly true to the movie (the Top Gun patch isn't used, a US Navy patch is missing, and juxtaposed) it is close enough to look outstanding and convincing.  The suit itself is actually pretty high quality and stylish compared to some of the other variants out there.  Really pleased and I'm looking forward to Halloween!!!

  I was looking for a low maintenance costume that looked good while still gave me the comfort of being in it all night. This fit my needs perfectly. I went with the Large as I'm 6'2 215 and it fit pretty well. The velcro bands on the side that are meant to give the costume a more tailored look were helpful, but I was still unable to completely fill out the costume around the waste.

  Ordered this off Amazon because I couldnt find it at any local stores. Quality made and looked good. My issue was I am 6'2"" at 250lbs so I went ahead and ordered the 2XL because I wanted to make sure it fit me being taller than normal. The fit was awful it was extremely baggy and the inseam was way too short. I could only bear to wear it for a short period of time due to the inseam. So I ended up wearing it with the top down and tied around my waist. Overall great look but not made for taller people.

  as a point of reference, i served in the navy and wore a flight suit every days for several years, so i know how these things are supposed to be made.  that said, i'm really impressed with the quality of this costume.  the material is a good, medium weight poly with excellent stitching. i have washed the costume and it held together fine...none of the seams came apart. all of the zippers are of good heavy quality and they actually work.  lots of pockets for carrying stuff around if needed.  all the patches look great and really make this flight suit stand out from others -- there were 3 mavericks (including me) at the halloween party i attended this year but none of their flightsuits looked as authentic as mine.on the sizing: i'm 6'1"" and 205 lbs...the XL was slightly large, especially in length -- if your inseam is less than 34"" then you should probably go with a large or be prepared to roll up the legs...which really won't work since the legs have the zippers at the bottom to widen the legs to allow you to pull the suit on over shoes/boots.

  First, let's talk the fit. It was perfect.I am 5'8 tall and weigh 160 Lbs. I wear a size 10 in ""regular clothes"", sometimes an 8.I bought the Size Large Costume and it was perfect for my height and ""larger"" body.The red sash covers the middle so you can set it up in whatever way you feel best. I bought some Ninja Sais and tucked those into the red sash and I looked very authentic!The costume material is actually good quality. It did not rip, tear or lose its shape. The black provides a slimming effects and holds in those loose ends. I get nervous about "" catsuits"" but this one made me feel confident and secure. I wore for a party and it was the best. I did not worry about feeling fat all night or pulling and tugging at straps or a short skirt.Even so, I still received lots of positive feedback from my costume. I am actually going to just handwash it and wear it again for another party coming up.Important Points:Have a decent undergarment for the bust. The cleavage is cut low so be prepared to work with it if you have to wear a bra .My bra kept showing all night but that was my fault for not having the right bra. I will not make that mistake on this next party.Also, other buyers mention the straps on the arms and legs coming off and falling down all night. I did not have this issue. On the pants I actually took red thread and sewed the straps directly onto the leg. I just wrapped the straps up the leg firmly like the photo and then held them in place and sewed it on at random points. All night long, the straps stayed perfectly in place. For the arms, I did the same and on one I just wrapped it up the arm and then put a safety pin at the top. Worked like a charm. The straps stayed in place even with my dancing around and being crazy and acrobatic. You can do the same for the sash, so the sash doesn't keep spinning and moving around. If you follow those steps you should not any issue with the arm or leg straps falling and the material does not get ""ruined"" by putting pins in it or sewing onto it so sew away. Its pretty resilient.

  I wasn’t convinced wether I was going to like this or not but it had such great reviews. All in all it’s very flattering. My comments would be that the top seems good quality but the fabric on the leg part is thinner. I feel like you could probably see through it. It’s also not as slimming because of that. I like the tie details but you would definitely need to tack them down because they shift. I added a satin corset over it for more structure and detail. Very flattering on the bust line if you are larger. There’s no zipper so if you have to pee you have to pull the whole thing off lol. Fit was pretty dead on except the legs are long at the ankles and kind of bunchy. I’m 5’4” and 140lbs for reference.

  I absolutely love this costume! Great cut , well made and sooo flattering . I am 5' 6"" and weigh 135 lbs and I bought a medium and it's perfect . I want to go incognito so this is perfect with the face mask and hood . I bought a leather utility belt to wear with it so my friends don't recognize ( and I don't have to carry ) my purse . I wrapped the red ties around my leg a couple times and then once around my waist on each side . They are long enough to do so and it keeps them from falling down . I am thinking of tacking them with a needle and thread in a couple spots to keep the X in the ties in place . I am already thinking of repurposing this costume and cutting off the ties and painting bones for a skeleton costume next year . The jumpsuit with the hood is so cool , if it was a different material I would wear this out regularly  . The cut is just so great . I totally recommend this to anyone , it's one of the most flattering "" cheap"" costumes I have ever bought. Oh and I am a C cup and my regular ( black ) bra works perfect and is not too revealing at all . I guess depending on the look you want , I'm sure if you wear a push-up bra it will definitely accentuate your bust , but my bra is perfect and does not show too much .

  I'm 36dd, 185#, 5'7"". It was about 3 inches too short which made arms extremely tight and shoulders pull down. Leggings fit well. Flattering if you can get back to zip. Impossible to do alone in bathroom breaks as the whole costume needs to come off. Wear black bra and undies as it's a bit sheer- maybe even body shaper under it. Made for smaller chested women. Of appearance in the chest area- the lines for across the nips due to me being fuller on that area and tall but are designed to go under bust line.  Will need push up bra for advertised cleavage effect. Fabric flimsy and came with rip at bottom of the zipper buy couldnt return for exchange since they were out of Large when i tried.

  I dread shopping for Halloween costumes because adult costumes do not fit me well, but teen/tween costumes look too juvenile for my taste. For reference: I am 5'4'', 100-103 lbs, and wear 25 W 32 L in Levi's jeans. I actually tried on this exact costume in a size XS in the Halloween store and it was a little loose along my legs and torso. I thought to look online and see if there were smaller sizes and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they carried this in XXS! Finally! An adult costume with a wide range of sizes!!First off, this costume fits me like a glove! It's so sexy while remaining classy and no part of the costume is see-through even though the fit is a tight bodysuit. For the price, you get 5 items which is well worth your money. The torso length was not too tight on me and there is enough stretch to fit someone taller than me. Additionally, the leg length is quite long with extra room at the bottom to spare, so it can fit people that are just as skinny but with longer legs. I have skinny arms to accompany my skinny legs, and the gloves also fit me perfectly without slouching down! The mask is just as comfortable and well-fitting (and perfectly on theme for the pandemic). All in all, I highly recommend this costume!

  I'm a size 10 in jeans, 5'5 1/2, 175lbs with 36D, bought a large, it looked great, it was cold for Halloween so I wore long sleeve and leggings underneath, it still looked great. If it wasn't cold I was only going to wear leggings and a Cali because it was a little too low cut to go trick or treating with the kids. By all means it is just spanx, no one really looks that good in spanx unless you're a Power Ranger. The red fabric around the waist was a nice accent even though, again it's Spanx. The one thing that bothered me was the red fabric that's suppose to ties at the thighs kept falling. The price is pretty decent for a costume like this. Granted most Halloween costumes aren't meant to last and made pretty cheaply. The fabric wasn't thick, nor was it THAT thin but I wore leggings just in case.

  I ordered a medium, it was pretty tight but I thought it was perfect. Im around 150 pounds I thought the medium fit me great. I got so many compliments. It’s a little thin but not see through. It’s so stretchy and durable I washed it twice and it didn’t affect it at all. I loved this costume. The red sash also cover the little pouch I have on my belly so thumbs up to that. The top is a little low but I don’t have a big bust so it was great for me I just wore a low cut black bralette under it. The only downfall was the red ties didn’t stay up they kept falling down my legs I just used pins to hold them up other than that it was sexy yet not to revealing. I would recommend to anyone!

  I am a size 12 pants, large or xl shirt. My chest is small but my shoulders and arms are big. My legs and calves are big. So this was a little tight in the butt area and the arms and back. But it actually fit id just need someone to zip it for me. If you are big in the arms or legs definitely try a large or bigger than that. Medium definitely would not have fit me.It’s cute and sexy and I like how the front flap kind of covers if you are a bigger girl and have a bit of stomach.Material stretches surprisingly.

  This is a really good costume for th price. I was going for a less slutty look that would be similar to Mortal Kombat. It fit as expected. I ordered a large (I'm 5""7 and 170 with a proportioned hourglass figure). It was very low cut so I personally wore a front criss cross bralette under it. I looked pretty slim in it and the sash helps to cover problem areas. The leg and arm straps do not stay up that well, but that is expected. Just tie them tight and it will be less of an issue. You can also sew them into place or use safety pins.

  I can't even explain how much I love this costume. I felt sexy without feeling slutty. You can wear something under the top if it is too low-cut. As-is, you should be wearing a ""U Plunge"" type of bra, or else the front will be very visible. I also grabbed some 2 sided tape to be sure everything stayed in place. It is very flattering and the waist scarf is great if you have a bit of a tummy. The material was thick enough that it wasn't see-through. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the arm and leg ties do not stay in place. I knew this was a potential issue from reading other reviews, so I put the costume on and tied the strings and sewed a couple points in place.

  This costume was definitely a hit! It's just the right amount of sexy! I added a corset and loved the way it looked. You definitely cannot wear a regular bra with this. I wore the rabbit lift bra and it worked great. Double sided fashion tape will be your best friend! I used it to keep the top in place and on the red strings that go around your legs. I had to give it 4 stars because  it's extremely tedious to use the bathroom when wearing this outfit because it's a body suit. Imagine wearing this with a corset, having to reappy fashion tape, etc. All while you're trying to have a good time drinking. Other than that it looks great!

  I like this costume. Only issue I have is the bottom leg part of the pant is a bit loose on my ankles. I'm 5'1 weigh 140 got a medium. Maybe some one taller wouldn't have this problem. Nothing a pair of boots won't cover. The material isn't too thin or thick. It's fitted but not suffocating. I'm a b cup and the top portion worked well although I would have liked to fill it out more it's very open. Otherwise I love it. Good price for a good costume.

  Sexy costume for my wife.  Maybe a little too sexy.  Exactly as pictured.  It looks really good but not exactly PG with the tight fit and cleavage.  She loves how it looks and so do I but it is slightly risque.  You probably could modify it to be a little more friendly for something like a church trunk or treat or your neighborhood pumpkin patch. With some slightly looser fitting black pants and maybe a small black sweatshirt.

  Ordering clothing can be a gamble but you can’t beat the price so I took a chance. My usual size in bottoms is medium but my hip measurements actually fell into “large”. I ordered medium anyway because a large would never work for my upper body. It fits perfectly! As everyone else mentioned, the leg wraps will probably need to be pinned. I didn’t mess with it too much yet.Bra suggestion... fullness v bra cleavage booster (something like that). I found it when buying this.

  This is a great costume! All you need to do is add boots and you're set - everything else is included. The fit is snug, but not overly tight. Your cleavage will definitely be on display. If you don't like that look you'll want to put a piece of lace or other material in the ""v"". Your butt will also be pretty prominent, so again if you don't want that you can cover it with a skirt or larger scarf than what is provided.As other reviewers have noted, the red strips of material will fall down if not fastened. I used a glue gun to keep them in place and that worked fine. It just takes a little time to get them right then glue them.I only wore the mask for a few minutes because I didn't like breathing in my own breath. It looks good for pictures though!Overall I highly recommend this costume if you want a slinky look. Once you have it on it's really comfortable except for having to use the bathroom. That takes a while since it is a jumpsuit. But I felt good all night and never felt like I had to constantly adjust it, like you do for some costumes.

  This was a fun costume to wear for one time use. Looked and fit great, but after the costume was washed, the black dye from the body of the costume bled and caused the red ribbons to become discolored. It was washed with cold water only on a gentle cycle, so I was expecting the fabric to retain its color and quality a bit better. Now that it's been washed it just doesn't look and fit the same as when it was purchased. If you are looking to buy it, it fits pretty true to size, except lengthwise if you're short like I am. I'm 5'2"" and a medium (dress size 8) was perfect. I wore a pair of boots, so the extra length in the legs was not noticeable.

  I'd like it if it were a little bit roomier in the hips and thighs, but it does work and it looks good.  Can't wait to try it out tomorrow night!  As other reviewers noted, this is a GREAT item if you WANT to look good/sexy but still be wearing a reasonable quantity of clothes for Halloween (i.e. if you feel awkward in so many of women's costumes which are WAY too flimsy - this manages to be both sexy and not flimsy.)  The full length body suit would (IMO) look awful on a lot of people EXCEPT for the red sash, which you can position wherever you like to cover up a multitude of lumps and bums, and the other red accents.  Overall, great costume.

Bought it for Halloween in Philadelphia and luckily we had a warm night that night. it was extremely long on me (as most things are) but I wore thigh high boots so it didn't really matter to me that it was too long. I am a B cup and the chest part was slightly big to where it shifted a little but nothing was hanging out. Also it was delivered much faster than expected (i think within one week).

  Overall I like this product. I got compliments on it at our Halloween party.This product was definitely as pictured. The only things I had to keep adjusting all night were the straps on the gloves and legs. I am in between sizes 12 and 14 and my height is 5'11,"" weight is about 180 lbs. I bought XL thinking that I would have some room  . This was definitely a snug fit. If i was 185 lbs or 190, I don't think it would have fit me. The face mask that came with it was child size and did not fit over an adult size head. The cleavage on this costume is as pictured. I did not wear a bra ( size 38C), but I did use those sticky nipple covers.

  The costume does not have any zippers or buttons, so the only way in (and out) is through the top.  If you're planning to drink much with the costume, keep this in mind as it was very inconvenient to remove just to use the restroom.  Material is Lycra-spandex type, so the fit was perfectly form fitting.  Only drawback, the start of the wraps are sewn into the costume so you can tie it around your body.  However, even tying it around, because of the material of the costume, it was constantly sliding down and loosening.  I had to safety pin the wraps at the knot to keep them from slipping, which eventually caused holes in the costume by the end of the night.  Overall, I loved the look and got many compliments.

  I can't wait to wear this! I was a little concerned when I ordered it, because as you probably know, most Halloween costumes are made so cheap that you can see straight through them...especially the tight fitting ones. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the material on this costume is not see through at all. It's actually quite thick. I tried it on and it fits perfectly, looking super cute and sexy without having to show a ton of skin. I ordered the medium (I'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs).  Even though it is a one piece, it fits my legs and long torso without any awkward creepage lol. Only thing is the red ties for the legs and arms don't stay in place. One end of each of the ties is already sewn on to the material, but then when you wrap it, the ties slide down. I will have to permanently sew the ties where I want them to stay. I still need to find some cute knee high boots to go with it...and it's definitely going to require a U-Plunge Bra.

  I used tiny safety pins to hold the red fabric straps in place, otherwise they fall down . This was comfortable, looked great on and was really sexy without being overly revealing.

  Loved my ninja costume. It was perfect for the party I attended. It fit great. Only reason it did not get 5 stars was the red tie for the leg kept on sliding down. Because the material was so slick it would not stay up. So be advised and prepared to either continuously pulling them up or just stuffing them into your purse.

  Great costume, but the arm and leg wraps fall down. it became a constant battle on halloween to keep them tied up. You need to sew or pin them in place some how to prevent them from falling down after wearing it more than a few minutes. Otherwise the top is very flattering and the whole body suit actually fit. its hard to find costumes for XS petite women!

  The costume fit me well.  I looked at the recommended size from the company based off of my measurements, and it was perfect.  I only gave it three stars because as some previous reviewers have stated, you'll really need to sew the leg wraps if you'd like them to stay up all night.  I wore it the day before Halloween and they kept falling down, no matter how tight I tied them.  Same for the arm wraps.  Glad I took it for a test run.  Also, note that the front is extremely low.  I sewed mine up a bit in the front and it was perfect for me.

  Item fits as expected, it's not hot, but also isn't really breathable fabric. It's great for 60-70 degree weather. Of course the stitching will start ripping with constantly pulling up the neckline to cover the bra or boobs.

  I was extremely relieved when this costume arrived as I did not have time to purchase and return before our Halloween party.  It was beautiful, just like pictured.  I didn’t purchase the gloves because I thought they may get in the way while eating, and was happy with that decision.  I added some jewels that I bought at Michaels to the necklace to give it some extra bling.  I typically wear a size 6, but purchased a size larger in fear it may run small.  I would have been fine with the smaller size but it worked just fine.  I am a 36 D and the top was slightly larger than I hoped.

  It's beautiful but the fit is awkward! I bought it for costume night on a Disney cruise. I had to steam the severe creases before we left home and then repack it to wear on the cruise. The top is saggy and for lots of chest! IT's very low cut. I wore a white tank under and it worked fine. the waist isn't really proportioned well to the chest--the waist is snug. I usually wear a medium and it worked fine--but was snug. The fabric is wonderful and it feels so elegant when wearing! The puffed sleeves are a tad bit itchy wear they hit your arm, but not too bad for a few hours. I'm 5'7"" and it was at least 8 inches too long for me! I cut and hemmed it before we left on the cruise so I wouldn't step on it all day. It's a really great quality costume for the price.

  I got this costume in order to dress up as Cinderella for children's parties and immediately fell in love with it! I ordered a small because that's the size I typically am and it for as expected. I love that the back part is strechy too so it's very comfortable to wear. The material is very nice- not see through at all. Obviously it came a little long but I'm also 4'11 so that was expected- better too long than too short!!! The only two things I dislike is how low cut it is (but I expected that from the picture) and that part of the sleeves are itchy (but you should expect that with pretty much any costume!)

  The dress in and of itself was ok, it did run large on me. However, I bought ""Brand New"" and when I opened the dress, it had smeared makeup and lipstick on the inside and also sweat stains in the armpits. Needless to say, it did not smell well either. Luckily, amazon stepped up to the plate and helped correct things with a different manufacturer. I ended up getting the same dress from a different manufacturer in a smaller size.

  My 3.5 year old daughter told me I needed to be Cinderella for Halloween this year, so I bought this dress and it was LEGIT. After reading the reviews I also bought a hoop skirt for underneath and I think that was a good call. It made the dress a lot more full and ""princessy"". The dress comes with the blue headband and black choker. I bought the wig, opera gloves, and hoop skirt separately. I bought the L size. I typically wear a size 10 clothes. I have a large bust (36DDD) so sometimes, finding dresses that fit appropriately all over is a challenge. But the L worked out well and I even felt like it may have been slightly large in some places. I am 5'6 and this dress was VERY long, even with the hoop underneath. I had to hold it up to walk (I was wearing flats). Halloween was a great success, however, and numerous little girls in our neighborhood stopped to take pictures with me while we were trick or treating. You will BRING the Cinderella in this costume.

The costume was BEAUTIFUL and well made, I loved the material because it didn’t feel cheap, especially for the price. I had to return it though because it was too small. The 1X might be a good fit, but judging from the way the L fit, the 2X would’ve fit well/maybe slightly loose but I like it better that way than too tight. It was also very long but that’s to be expected because I’m so short. I ordered the Snow White costume from the same company and they’re made from completely different material.

  The dress I received what actually very well made and super cute. I think it was better than what you buy in the stores. The back side of the dress bodice is made of a stretchy material so it does have some give. I'm usually a small/medium in dress sizes so I figured, order a size up. I received the medium and had to send it back. A small would have probably fit much better. Also, the dress was long and I had intended on wearing sparkly flats with this dress which it would have drug on the ground by an inch. It could have easily been hemmed if needed. I am 5'5"" 130 LBS.

  I bought this for my daughter, dutifully measuring her waist and checking the size chart to find the right size.  We bought a 1X/2X, which claims to be for waists 33-37"".  The dress was way too big for me, and my waist is 39"".  We're returning it.  The dress looks nice, but was itchy, and sheds glitter.

  Giving this dress 4 stars because it runs very big and I didn't have enough time to exchange it for a smaller size. I'm 5'11 and I weight 220 lbs and the XL was way too big.

  My daughter requested that I dress as Cinderella for Halloween, so I ordered this expecting it to be most like cheap costumes-- one time use quality. This exceeded all expectations-- parents at my daughter's school actually thought I was a professional the school hired to come in costume! It fit wonderfully, and the quality is excellent.

  I definitely was not wow’d by this costume. It fit ok, but the quality was not really great and the wrinkles in the dress were so ridiculous and couldn’t even get out one wrinkle so I’m returning it since I couldn’t wear it.

  I wore on Halloween. All the teachers on my team were princesses.  It was a bit low cut but I was able to see in a little strip of lace fabric so there wasn’t too much exposure on top.

  Love this dress. I will be wearing it to Disney World. It does run long which is great for me since I am 5""7 and there is about an extra 5 inches in length. The dress fits well. I usually wear about a size 6-8  and am smaller in the bust. I could wear a medium but since I am wearing this to Disney with my kids I don't want it to be too tight and revealing.  However from my experience working in a Halloween store many leg avenue costumes do run small and on the short side.It's very pretty on.

  Beautiful costume, but be careful with it! If you pull too hard near the zipper, you risk ripping a seam. The costume shipped quickly, but arrived VERY wrinkled. However, it ironed out nicely (lowest setting, higher heat made the fabric turn tacky, and you risk melting the garment). Just flip inside out when you iron, and be prepared for your ironing board to be covered in loose glitter. Got this for a princess party and am so excited to put the full costume together!

  This is a great costume! Great material, hemming, details and durability. It was simply beautiful and i received so many amazing compliments. I wore this for a company party and had children coming up to me for pictures. so sweet!Other reviews are accurate that this is very long. I am 5'5, and even with 3"" heels, it still drug at least 3""+ on the floor. Unless you are 6', you will likely have to shorten this. Also, the upper portion is very stretchy to give you extra comfort, but don't let this fool you to get a smaller size. This is for comfort.To be helpful, I am a very curvy 5'5 woman. My measurements are 36 DDD chest, 33 waist, and 43 hip, and 188 lbs. I ordered a Large and it was perfect. I will emphasize that I have a small waiste compared to my other measurements and weight, and this is why the large was comfortable. This is a fitted look up top, so it you have a waiste larger then a 36, I would probably go a size larger to be safe.This did come with the headband and black necklace, I had to buy my own long white gloves.All in all, a super adorable and great for the price, costume.Oh, be aware, you will be shedding glitter everywhere you go. If possible, take this out of the package outside to shake out, or in a bath tub to rinse down. My bedroom was full of glitter, as well as my car. Lol

  I would have liked an extra small as I am usually a petite 0 or 2.  It fits well enough in the bodice as its spandex.  The dress is much nicer than I anticipated and I am pleased.  I could easily iron it.  It does need a petticoat and I ordered one separately which then crested the dress as pictured.  The petticoat was inexpensive.  About $25.  I also found inexpensive cute glass slipper this shoes on Shoebuy.com.  It is worth the price.

  I ordered this dress for Halloween. It's what you would expect from a cheaper costume maker. It wasn't made from the sturdiest of fabrics but would definitely hold up for a few nights of fun. It looked very similar to the picture but I would order a crinoline to ""fluff it up."" Also, the bodice portion of the dress was very low cut. I'm 5'4 so perhaps it would work better on a taller person? I'm not sure.

  Longer than I thought it would be based on the image... (how is it that short on her when the sleeves seem to reach all the way to her hands?)Also mine came with a raisin?? Like... a shriveled grape. It was a large raisin as it seemed to be half of one, but still the size of a typical sun-maid raisin. But it probably wasn’t a sun-maid raisin because it was reddish rather than black. And as I said, half of this one was the size of a whole sun-maid raisin. I didn’t taste test it or anything. I just threw it out and put the dress on.I was hoping it would be shorter on me but it goes pretty low. Being a guy, I was hoping it would be more of a hoodie than a dress hoodie. But whatever. The sleeves are almost too short but they’re not. I am 5’5” 125 lbs  and ordered a medium. It is very warm, light weight, and soft. I think I look cute.

  Not what is pictured. At all. Not even close. I’ll add a picture because I’m just baffled.I bought a large because my measurements matched the size chart. Nope. Too small.Ordered this in an XL and while it fits and it looks like a bat costume it is not a dress. It is more of a jumper rather than a dress. Now, I totally would’ve just kept it but when I lift my arms for bat position it give the ultimate wedgie.

  it's just a wee bit too tight. i feel bad for anyone who is actually a size 3x as it will cling and look lumpy. i normally fall between 1x and 2x and i am happy i chose the 3x size for wiggle room. the material is a bit thicker than i expected, a sort of thick felt. it's warmer than my usual fall hoodie, even! the furry material is not the most beautifully attached to the hood but it's fairly hard to notice. be sure to wear something underneath if you plan to reach for anything over your head. as you can see from my picture, the wings are fully attached to the body of the dress and will certainly pull it up. overall, i am satisfied with this costume/coat but the wings could have been made a little wider for ease of movement. i'm chalking up the frequent knocking things over issue to my horrible spatial awareness and depth perception problems. #blindasabat

  I had reservations about this, but am ultimately very happy with the purchase. As others have said, the outfit is more of a hoodie than a dress. I am pretty short at only 5'2""  so I could have worn it as a dress, but I still chose to wear it with shorts. It is very warm and thick, and the hood rests just right. The bosom is a little tight and while the fuzzy hood accent is a nice touch, it makes it look more like a cat than a bat. I had to order a size up, and the bosom was still a little snug, but other than that, I love it, and plan to wear it as a hoodie for the entire month of October every year to come!

  I'm really torn on how to review this. On one hand, it is incredibly cute, and I love wearing it. The ears and wings are especially darling. On the other, the material is super cheap and bit unpleasant. Also, I wear a small in literally every item of clothing...except for this costume. I'm a size 4, and I had to order an XL so that I didn't feel like a sausage squeezed into a weird fleece casing. It is also very warm, as other reviewers have noted. (This is a plus for me, since I'm always cold, but if you tend to be even a little bit warm, this will probably be too hot for you to wear.)

  I debated on this costume for a week before I purchased it. I read reviews, checked size charts, made SURE I ordered the right size. It came today and it’s tiny! I’m 5’4 and 170lbs... someone else wrote a review saying they were 5’4 180lbs and she ordered an xl, so I ordered an xl as well. I USUALLY WEAR A LARGE! This thing is SO small that my 12 year old fits in it! (My daughter is the one in the pic). I couldn’t even zip it up. I’m going to be livid if they charge me a restocking fee like they did others.

  I absolutely pick my Halloween costumes based on how warm they can keep me and my and my frozen toes are in love with this giant bat hoodie! The fabric is like a blanket, the hood is INTENSELY CUTE, and the wing/arms are so much fun! This thing definitely runs small, though. I'm 5""5' and a 34B and I usually wear small/medium, but ordered a large for this based on reviews. It only just zips up on me! I'd have probably have been comfy in an XL as well! Fortunately, I won't be needing to layer for warmth wearing this delightful thing. The only downside I've noticed? The foam bits making up the claws and ears do take a couple days to dry (it's wet here in autumn; this happens). The blanket-like fabric also doesn't breathe very well, so if you're in a warmer spot you will definitely start sweating. On the other hand, I slept in this just fine the other night so if you're also that person who is cold all the time and has six blankets in the winter, I bet you'll like this as much as I do!

  This costume is really nice, easy to wear, perfect for Halloween! (and, frankly, for lounging around playing video games). It's comfortable - cheap material, of course, but still comfortable - and warm. Here are my main points:1. Sizing - definitely order 1-2 sizes larger than you usually wear. I wear L usually; I got XL in this and I'm so glad I did because the XL is snug on me and I had to stretch the fabric slightly to get it to zip up all the way. So order 1 size larger if you want it snug, 2 if you want wiggle room.2. Construction - it's polyester so don't dry it in a machine or this costume will wind up even smaller than it originally was! But for the price, the fabric is pretty good and the seams are all sewn together well. The 'fur' on the hood and ears is really soft and nice, the hood is big enough to drape down on the forehead a bit which is nice. I'm impressed with the zipper too, which is a nice fat one instead of those cheap 'invisible' ones that always snag on the fabric and quickly break.3. Wearability - 10/10, this is great! Easy, comfortable. Definitely warm so that's nice for trick-or-treating outside, but may be a bit too hot at a crowded party indoors. Of course in that case you can always unzip it and still wear the wings and hood. Do plan on wearing shorts or leggings because this is just a jacket, no bottoms included.Overall, I'm thrilled. :) My favorite costume for years!

  I ordered a size up after reading reviews. I love this costume. It is incredibly warm and indeed cozy. While it seems to be made just out of cheap felt or fleece, it still is very warm. I had some loose strings that were easy to cut. I wore this costume with a long-sleeved black shirt underneath, fleece-lined leggings, and black boots. I also wore a bat mask and false sharp canine teeth. People complimented me on my costume. Because I was going to an outdoor party, I wanted something warm, and I got it. I think with fishnet leggings or other pants, and no shirt underneath, this would work just as well for an indoor party as well.

  Absolutely adorable bat costume or warm Halloween themed-bat jacket! I wore this for Halloween to a friend’s party and was the only one not cold outside and I got tons of compliments! If anything I was too hot inside the house, but it was just as cute unzipped With a cute tunic top and leggings and I brought a spare set of ears in case I had to take it off. I bought both a medium and a large because sometimes I’m in between sizes. They both fit but the large fit better in length and space to wear an outfit under while still showing my curves. The shorter length of the medium looked funny on me because the center point on the bottom front hemline hit at my crotch area in a funny place. I found it to be distracting. I ended up giving the medium size to my sister who is 5’2” and it looked better on her. For reference I am 5’4”, 36DDD, hourglass shaped. I usually order a large in this kind of apparel because of my bust and I like things to fit a little on the loose side, but still fitted, rather than tight to the body.

  My 16 year old is around size 10 and the XL was tight and bunched up terribly on her.

We sized up to a 3x for eldest, which was a touch long for her taste, but nice and flowy, like she wanted.  (I like the length since she can raise her arms without showing off her butt.)

  I ordered one size above my usual size (normally 1X/2X, I ordered the 3X/4X), and the fit was great.

My one complaint is that there is no good reason there are NO pockets on this hoodie!

  The first one I ordered was much too small for a medium. I could barely zip up and was super short so I returned.  Just received the large and it was definitely used.

  I was worried this wouldn't fit since leg avenue does run a tid bit small but luckily it is perfect. if you are more on the 4x side, this might not work for you. it does have a decent amount of stretch but it is still snug. sleeves are just the right length, hood stays on well and the ears actually balance well ( i was worried they would flop to one side or the other ). the only complaint i have is that this might end up being to warm lol.  i will for sure wear this for more than halloween :D Oh and it def does not come with tights or anything, it is just the dress hoodie.

  I've worn it as a jacket; it's great for a chilly day, though probably not for a ""freezing"" one. It's a bit snug, but not in a constricting way. Short on my arms, though I'm long-limbed so that wasn't unexpected. Major plus on the length; it goes past my bottom and I have a long torso, too. The biggest drawback is the lack of pockets and somewhat restricted movement due to the wings (which was an issue mainly when buckling into the car).I'm going to wear it as often as possible.Bonus: I didn't notice it in the pictures so I was pleasantly surprised at the thumb-claw!

  I usually wear a size 10 so I ordered a large and it fit pretty well. The fur around the hood wasn’t the best quality but the costume itself was super cute. I though it was pretty flattering on- the wings help hide if you’ve got a little bit of a belly. It’s a very thick fleecy material. I ended up returning because it was too heavy for me and I didn’t want to sweat all night. I live in Florida so even a cool Halloween is likely to not be cool enough for this heavier material. That’s the only reason I returned it.

  I wanted a nice easy, comfortable costume that I can just throw on. This is good for that if you plan on being outside all Halloween night in Maine. Otherwise, this is just way too warm. I live in NJ, where it can be anywhere between 45 and 65 on Halloween, and I think I would still be sweating in this even if it was on the colder side. There’s no way I would be comfortable wearing this inside at all. This is a no-go for me. For size reference, I usually wear 14-16, and the 1x-2x fit well. It’s fitted, but not tight.

  Based on others' reviews, I ordered a size up (I normally wear medium, but ordered a large), and that may have been a mistake. The length was good in a large, but I still wore leggings underneath just in case. The hood was rather loose / floppy, so the fake fur trim kept getting in the way of my eyes. I might've preferred to have a medium for this reason. If you're already planning on wearing leggings or something underneath it, you may want to just order your regular size. It's a cute costume and I will definitely reuse it. It's also very warm, which is great if you're wearing it outdoors. It may be *too* warm if you're at a crowded indoor party. One other thing to note - the bat wing sleeves felt slightly awkward while driving. I was afraid the seams might rip when I extended my arms to hold the wheel, but that did not happen. It might have felt more awkard if I had ordered my regular size.

  I received what was clearly someone's (possibly used) returned item, that was jammed halfway into the open package and covered with lint and threads. (So much for quality control and presenting the customer with a fresh/new looking item).Although It seemed to be well made and of decent quality, the costume itself was about two sizes too small.I am not happy with the idea of returning it and having to pay a restocking fee, simply to have the chance to try it on.

  I love this costume.  I bought it to wear to my kids' preschool for their halloween party.  Super comfortable with black leggings and a black tshirt.  The kids liked it, and I can see this lasting a lot longer than most halloween costumes.  The quality is great.  It's made of thick fleece and is very warm.  Some people have mentioned that the hood is way too big.  It's just the style of it, and I like it.  I haven't had any problem with the ears being floppy.  The ears on mine stay up like they should.I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs.  The medium fits me great.  It's big enough that I can comfortably wear layers under it, but slim enough that it's flattering to my figure.  I got a lot of compliments on it, and would definitely recommend it.

  I have to disagree with the reviews saying it isn't true to size and to size up. I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small depending on the brand. I ordered this in a M and it fits perfectly fine on me. I was worried the sleeves would be too big for me as I'm really short but they worked great. For reference I usually wear a size 6/8 or S/M and I'm 5ft. I loved this outfit, my preschoolers were studying bats and I knew it was the perfect Halloween costume. The kids loved it and I was super warm and cozy all day. I will say that this wouldn't be super comfy if you live in a climate that is very warm in October.

  Per other reviews, this fits VERY small.  By the measurement chart, I would have been an XL, but thanks to other reviewers' advice, I purchased a 3X, which fit perfectly.  TRUST the reviewer sizing on this...the cut and fit is much, much smaller than the charts proclaim.  That said, the costume is super-cute.  The body is fleece, jacket-weight, and the hood (as pictured) is black fun-fur.  It looks just like the photo.  :)  I'm really happy with it, and have no doubts I'll be nice and warm!  I would have rated this item 5-stars because I love it overall, but had it not been for other helpful reviewers, it would have been too small to wear.

  As many other reviews have already noted, this runs VERY SMALL. I'm typically a US size 8 and I got an XL, which fit. If I were ordering again, I'd get an XXL because the XL is very snug when zipped up. I'm 5'1"" and the sleeves were a bit long but not unmanageable. There's a decent range of movement especially when unzipped, but the wing size makes it a difficult to reach your arms up. Pretty warm but I haven't tried washing it yet and it feels a bit like a very thick craft felt rather than clothing grade fabric and tbh I'm not convinced it would come out of a wash looking the same. Got lots of compliments and it was really comfy though. I'm very happy with the purchase overall despite the quality of the fabric.

  This is a great costume for a chilly October night! It's basically a fleece zip-up hoodie made into a really cute bat costume.  I bought the children's one for my daughter and saw that they made this adult-sized one, and I couldn't pass it up. I am very pleased with the product.  **BEWARE---- it runs SMALL!!! I ordered a size-up based on the reviews I read, and it's perfect. I am 5'9"" and usually wear a 12-14, so I ordered a 1X/2X, and it fits great. I wouldn't want it to be any tighter or shorter. The length is also perfect for me, but I can see it being a little long if you are a shorter woman... unless you want to wear it like the model, then it will be just right.

  My personal measurements are:49 inch hips/32 inch waist/40 inch bustI had to order the largest size they have because of everyone saying it runs small. However, besides the ridiculous size China sizing, it fitted me perfect. And way more cozy than I thought it would be. I wear it around the house as a jacket. My only complaint is the hood is so huge and it covers my face. The fuzz on the hood isn't good quality and has started getting in my eyes.

  Im currently 35 weeks pregnant and a pre pregnancy size large/10. I found the jacket to fit pretty true to size, it wasnt tight on my shoulder/arm area, in fact theres some wiggle room. This jacket actually manages to zip over my gigantic belly and bust area which I was not expecting at all based off the comments saying how small this runs. Its meant to be more streamlined and fitted, so keep that in mind when choosing a size. I expect it to fit just fine after the baby is born. Very stretchy too and the fleece is warm.

  Its almost like a thick sweatshirt, was definitely warm for wearing to go take my son out trick or treating.  The body was a little snug for a large, but it is supposed to be fitted.  I wore leggings under it, as I felt it would be too short as a dress otherwise, and I'm only 5'3"".  Also, trying to get it to lay right with the hood up was hard, but people commented it was cute (though I think because my baby had a similar costume on), and most of the time I could keep it down and be comfortable.  The wings are the sleeves, and actually done well enough you could use your arms and not have the extra fabric get in the way.  I washed it (came out fine) and put it away to use again in the future.

  This costume is very cute, but not without flaws.  I do like the fact that it's a V-neck when zipped, because that's more comfortable to me. I expected the sizing to be a little off, but it's much smaller than I'd figured on. I bought a Large, and it's skin tight when zipped (and it's not flattering when it's that tight, it makes 'rolls' and lumps where I don't have them). I think I'll have to return this for a 1X, so that I can zip it comfortably with a light t-shirt under it.  Also, it's polyester felt -- not stretchy, ridiculously hot, and not breathable at all.  It feels like if you tug at it, the fabric will stretch into thin strips and tear apart.  For the warmth, if you live in the Midwest and sit outside in below-40-degree weather half of the time at Halloween like we do, you won't even need a coat when wearing this -- but you *will* be drenched in sweat because it's polyester.

  After reading reviews that said the fit was small or as expected, I decided to order a small anyway. I’m 5’1” 110lbs and based on the chart provided the brand suggested a small. The sleeves are perfect if not a smidge short - but it doesn’t bother me. Otherwise it fits great and looks cute. I’d say if you typically wear a small and you like a tight fit, then order a small. Otherwise if you’re inbetween it might be best to go one size up to have more room.  I was worried with the costume that even with the arms down you wouldn’t be able to tell what it is, but that’s not the case. It’s cute and I think it will keep me warm.

  I'm not big on halloween but I'm a nanny and trick-or-treating is in the job description. I wanted to dress up, but not as ""sexy nurse"" or any of the other scantily clad halloween tropes young women seem to get stuck with. Searched amazon for plus sized costumes hoping to find something a bit more conservative and got this! I was able to just wear black clothes under this costume/jacket/bat-hoodie and it was perfect! The hood stays put, the ears are filled so they stay up, the outfit was warm and comfortable and fit perfectly! This product is exactly as advertised and a perfect lazy costume.

  This bat costume is great for cold weather because it is thick fleece material.. The hood is super cute and stays up without assistance.

You just look like a black fuzzy blob with ears on a hoodie.... So, I lined the wings with bright fabric piping...

  I was not impressed with this outfit. This is basically just a black zip-up fleece hoody with yucky ""fur"". It was very unflattering on. Although I appreciated it's warmth while going house to house with the kids, it was oddly shaped- tight in some areas, too long & too big in other places. The hood was also very big and too floppy & oddly shaped to be much use. The ""fur"" around the hood was scratchy & messy & after wearing it for 2 hours I was completely broken out in a nasty itchy red rash all over my face, neck & chest. I definitely did not feel like I looked like a bat let alone a sexy one. In fact, I also felt like I appeared to be 10lbs heavier. This costume was a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it.

  I'm so glad I ordered this product! I waited & debated, then Amazon went out of stock so I pulled the trigger once the item was a slightly higher price, almost out of stock & not prime & I don't regret it one bit.I'm a curvy, top & bottom & am 5'6. I ordered the large since I normally wears jean size 31/32 again curvy not super skinny jeans & it's perfectly tight around my waist.I also plan to wear with thick leggings or black jeans depending on the weather. So I tried on over my normal jeans for the review.It's a snug fit so if you're going for a looser super comfy fit then order 2 sizes up.The product hits me mid thigh, in the front. A little too short in the back for me to wear alone, but you could get away with it especially with a short pair of running shorts on underneath.Upon opening the shipping envelope I was slightly concerned it'd be tough fabric that wasn't soft as the packaging is a no frills basic Halloween packaging, but fabric is soft & comfy. Only a few strings from seeing to trim which is not a big deal at all.Also has the great V neckline, even if it's zipped all the way up it doesn't go above a what a normal v neck shirt would and the fur goes all the way down to the zipper. The zipper doesn't have a second pull from the bottom so don't expect that.The ears on mine stand up without adding any additional support as they are stuffed so full they have no option but to stand up.There are also nice details I was surprised by like the wing hooks off the sleeve and the stitching that outline what would be the bats bones in the wing.There is also a v that goes down in the front and back, almost like a onesie that's unbuttoned (if a one size was a V) to account for the bats body I guess.All in all I'm super happy with the purchase and excited for Halloween. A simple yet cute outfit that I can definitely wear year after year.I cannot confirm enough order a size or two up & order it before it goes out of stock if you're debating on getting it at all! 😊Will try to update with pics later.

  This sweater is great if you are looking for a cute, but no-fuss/low maintenance costume option.  Also, if warmth and comfort are on your list of costume must haves - this sweater is perfect!I've worn this for outside events (temps in 30s - 40s) with warm base layer top and tights beneath - and I was warm with no jacket needed.  I have also worn this for inside events with a tank top and thin tights beneath, and was not too hot.Sizing was expected. 5'3"",145 lbs and busty - ordered a Large. Had no problems zipping, and did not feel it was too tight.

  I love this hoodie. After spending nearly $200 on a costume for Halloween, I saw this advertised on Amazon and just had to have it. It is so decently priced, I returned my other costume and bought this one instead and I am so glad I did!! Saved me a bunch and is even more cute than my previous costume!I am 5'5.5"" and 135 - 137 pounds; kind of a busty hour glass shape. This large hoodie fits me *perfectly*, just a little snug with a bit of space for wearing a sweater dress or something underneath. I could probably had bought a medium if I didn't want to layer under the hoodie. The length reaches just at a point that if I bend over it doesn't show my bum but I still will probably want to wear opaque leggings or short shorts under this just in case. My only wish would be to make the sleeves just a bit longer, but that is more personal preference because I have longer arms.The hoodie itself is better than the photo examples on Amazon. If you look up ""leg avenue bat costume"" on Google you will see that the hoodie's zipper actually goes all the way down and can open fully. It also is full fleece material, so it's insanely soft and warm. The hood is big, and looks great both up or down. The wings are super thick, not flimsy or cheap looking. Keep in mind this hoodie is very, very warm. It will be much too warm for anyone who gets hot easily, but perfect or someone who is worried about freezing outside on Halloween.This whole costume has a casual feel to it because of the cut and material, so this would be great for a casual Halloween party, for a teen who is trick or treating, or just someone who loves looking like a bat (judgement free zone here)!I posted this comment before Halloween so if someone is on the fence on buying this hoodie, i wanted to help that make the right choice. Go with this hoodie! It's awesome. I plan on posting reference photos post Halloween.

  I had found this item in a smaller size during Halloween and after one failed attempt to order from another Amazon retailer, I found it was from Legs Avenue and when I got this one, I was not disappointed! It's precisely the cute fleece cozy shown in the picture. Some people say to order a size or two up, but I found a large (my usual size) worked just fine for me.

  I knew those was going to be small, so I sized up. I wear this all the time, everywhere, i do not care how far from Halloween it is, it has become almost a signature piece of mine. I usually wear an xl, and I got a xxxl and it fit (almost) perfectly. Little tight in the chest area, but it's okay. The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the need to size up, I knew because I read reviews ahead of time, but some people may not know.

  I would normally wear a small, but I bought this in a large for a slightly loose, relaxed, oversized hoodie fit. I'm glad I ordered two sizes up, the sleeves are just the right length and there's just barely a little extra room underneath. It is also incredibly warm, so if that's something you're looking for in a costume, you won't be disappointed. I bought it as something to wear to the Disneyland halloween party. I wanted something to keep me warm outdoors late at night, something that wouldn't get in the way on rides or in crowds, or be at risk for getting messed up or losing pieces. Just something comfy, casual, cute, and also fits all the costume rules for the park. It is the perfect costume for what I was looking for and I'm very happy with it. There were just a couple things that kept me from giving it a 5-star review. First, that when I took it out of the package it had a very strong chemical odor that has taken a few days to air out, even after being washed. Second, the fur around the hood has a very rough edge, which I'm just picky about because I've worked with faux fur on craft projects before, and the craftsmanship seemed poorer than I expected for the price. However, it's still a cute costume that's perfect for what I need, and I expect I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of it!

  Loved this costume. Pretty much what I expected when I ordered it. I read through many, many reviews and they all said go up a size. I usually wear an extra large and I got the 1X/2X. Was still a tiny big snug in the waist area but overall really great costume. It is a dress and I wore fishnets under it. It did cover my butt. (I'm 5'7) It did get very warm even outside with the temp being about 65 degrees, it's made out of a fleece material from what I could tell. The ears are stuffed so they stay up very well. Overall, great purchase!

  This is basically a glorified BULKY hoodie. It’s long enough for leggings or tights to go under, I was under the impression it was more like a romper. The fabric is NOT flattering. It’s like Pajama fabric. The picture they use makes the model look cute and sexy, it’s really not - it’s bulky. Runs small, so order a size up. It’s comfortable to wear outside, but it’s not what I was looking for, and I don’t even know if I will ever use it.

  Reading the reviews before purchasing this product probably saved some last minute costume changes. I am 5'4"" and 135. I originally would have ordered a medium, but everyone said this costume ran small so I ordered a large and I am so glad that I did. I just opened it up and threw it on over my tshirt and jeans and it fit pretty tight, but i wouldnt want it any looser. I plan on just wearing a thin tshirt underneath with some leggings or tights since it is made very warm with fleece material and it will probably fit just right. The length hit about mid thigh for me, so tiny bit longer than hoped, but will still work for halloween. It came in a plastic packaging like you would buy from a halloween store so the material is a little bent in the wrong places. I might try to flatten them out before i wear it.

I was hoping the boots would arrive in time for my party...but they may not, as they come from another vendor. I live in Florida, so the boots would only be for looks.

  While I would normally wear a medium or large in hoodies, I got this in xl and it’s perfect. (Halloween costumes always tend to run small.) It’s super cute and very warm so if you’re going to be inside you might want to rethink it. The only reason I took away one star is because you can’t stretch your arms over your head comfortably.

  Great Halloween costume, super cute and warm. As with anything by this brand, it will show your butt, so if you're wearing it to the office party, might want to throw on some leggings.

Definitely double-check on the size, as I ordered a small (I'm technically an XS) and it fit my body great, but felt a touch tighter than I generally prefer on the arms, which probably honestly helped the wings stay in place without sliding.Consider purchasing Vampire Teeth, as it felt extra batty to me!

Skirt alot longer then I expected. Goes down about 4 fingers above the knee. I want it just a bit shorter for socks to be displayed so I pulled it up in the waste & the jacket & belt covers that up very well. Perfect!  The hat came nicely folded so you do not have to fix it at all. Open it, take clips off & it bounces to it's perfect shape. I love everything about this costume. Exactly as picture.

  This costume was a lot of fun to wear and was actually very comfortable since it had plenty of stretch to it.  I'm 165 and 5' 2"", 40C chest and a size Large fit me fine, though I did not wear a bra since the dress beneath was a bit snug on top.  The jacket fit as expected.  A couple a tweaks that I had to make, which were no big deal...  I turned the belt around so the velcro wouldn't pop open when I moved, and just moved the buckle over the velcro portion.  I safety pinned the jacket closed beneath the belt since it's only held closed by a tiny piece of velcro.  The hat pops up right after opening the package and looks great.  One thing, after about an hour the opening of the hat begins to stretch and fell badly over my face.  I'd recommend putting some kind of a little band in there to stop it from falling.  This costume is darling and has so much to it for the price.  I added the harlequiin Leg Avenue tights and my own boots. Purple lipstick is fun with this!!

  Overall, the costume was a hit! We decided not to wear the neck bowties, but we still got a lot of compliments on the outfits. From what I can tell  sizes Small-XL are a 5 pc costume, the dress is separate from the jacket. Plus sizes are only 4 pcs, the dress and jacket are one piece. I'm on the right. I personally liked the way the XL fit, and the costume seems to be very flattering on curvy women.

  I really love this costume! I admit I don't have much of a history with costumes (I only wore a store bought costume once as a teenager and now I am in my 30s) and I wasn't particularly interested in dressing up with my cousin for the Disney Halloween party, at least until I found this costume. The colors, the quirkiness, and the touch of sass make it just what I like! I was unsure about fit, but this fits me very well. It is just big enough on me that I can get it on and off without unzipping, but it doesn't look big on me. For reference my chest is 48 and my stomach is 47. Those seem to be the two areas that might make the fit iffy for the 3x/4x if someone is more than maybe a couple of inches larger. I don't think it needs a ruffled underskirt with it if you don't want one (I do not) and is long enough I can wear a pair of short shorts under it. The bow tie has trouble standing properly but I can probably rig is somehow.

  This was a SUPER cute costume!  But it runs very small.  I ordered a medium and the length barely covered my butt.  I’m 5’8” and  I range between a size 4 and size 6 in women’s clothing, and I am a bit curvy in certain areas.  Standing still it was okay but when I walked it kept riding up and I had to keep pulling it down all night.  Thank god for the jacket that came with it or it would’ve been a no go.The one other thing was that when I took it out of the package it was EXTREMELY wrinkled...it looked like someone had taken it out of the wash while it was wet, crumbled it up and put it in the packaging to ship out.  It says “do not iron” too!!  There was no way I could have worn it that way so I had to iron it...It took me 2 hours to try to iron it without scorching the material!!! I did scorch it in certain placed but that was way better than looking like a slob.  They need to at least attempt to fold it up so that it doesn’t arrive like that if they expect you to not iron it.  Other than that it was a great costume for the price!!

  I usually wear a 2x in most shirts, and a 3x in anything button up or with less give (I’m pretty busty). I got this in a 4 to be on the safe side, and I’m glad I did. It fit well, though a bit snugger than Iike. I wore it to a trunk or treat community thing at work and got a ton of compliments on it.

  This is a perfect, classic costume that I hope I get the chance to wear multiple times! I am 5’9” and about 240 lbs so I got the 3x/4x. Everyone said it was a beautiful costume and asked if I made it.  The hat is super comfy and the whole outfit was easy to put on without messing anything up even after I did some intense make up.  The zipper in the back makes it easier to get over broad shoulders but then stretches a little when you zip it back up so it looks like it fits you perfectly!Also the delivery was super fast and it was packaged well. I had a great time at my party and this outfit was a huge success!!

  Third time trying to write this....my laptop keeps jumping me out of the review.  Anyway, this is a super cute costume that fit fairly well except in the upper arms, where it felt a bit tight.  There is some stretch to the middle and the velveteen is very stiff, not uncomfortable but stiff.  I paired the outfit with some black/white vertical striped leggings, black ankle boots with lace-topped ankle socks, a black net crinoline slip and a super curly tri-color brown wig NOT a clown wig. I wanted something bouncy and fun.  The top hat is super cute too and fit over the wig just fine without feeling like it was going to pop off so unless you have a head bigger than a bowling ball, it should fit and stay on just fine.  I expect to get many many compliments with this one!!!  For reference,  I am 5' 3"" and usually wear a 2X ~ I bought this costume in the 3X-4X size which  fit around my big belly and with the velcro adjustable belt made me look more shapely., a nice extra bonus.  I LOVE this costume and recommend it to everyone!  Can't wait for Halloween!

  Cure costume except mine was missing the bow tie which is a big part of the costume. I ordered my normal size and it fits fine! Hoping I can get most of the creases out from the packaging and if the seller doesn’t respond about my missing bow tie I will have to look for one that goes w the costume. UPDATE no response from seller. Typical. $55 costume and it’s missing a piece! I ordered a black and white checkered bow tie to match the outline of the jacket and clash/coordinate w the striped/diamond pattern thigh highs I bought in black and white.

  I haven't dressed up since I was a child, but I've always wanted to. Time would just slip away from me or I couldn't decide on what to do. Last year was different. I found this on Amazon and fell in love with it. I've been working out a lot and have lost a good deal of weight, and wanted to really show that off. This costume is a really great mix of like a more modest sexy, if that makes sense. I was almost completely covered from head to toe, but was told over and over how beautiful and sexy I looked.I really felt so empowered in this costume!I'm 5,3"" 170lbs and 34DDD. Ordered a size large. The mini dress beneath the coat is extremely form fitting, but it is very stretchy! And the coat was snug in all the right places without hindering movement. My only complaints were that the coat, collar, and belt are secured by velcro and it's not the strongest velcro in the world. I sewed some buttons in to feel more confident nothing would pop open or off since I was going to be out partying with friends.

  Very awesome costume, got a a lot of compliments. I bought leggings separately at Walmart to go with it so I wouldn’t be cold and lace up “combat” boots as well. I wanted to get a petticoat to put under the skirt but ran out of time to buy one. Costume was comfortable and modest though I felt sexier in it.

  This Mad Hatter costume is so adorable!The costume comes with a dress, jacket, belt, neck tie & hat. The dress is a pull over style and is thin. The jacket is cozy and it comes together in the front with Velcro. The belt fastens in the back with Velcro as well as the neck tie. The jacket and hat are both like a faux velvet material. Very nice!The costume fit me very well. I am a size 5. The dress was a tad short but I wore leggings underneath it. It is very comfortable.

  The jacket was so pretty, the dress was a bit tight and small, however the worst part was that as soon as I opened the package containing the costume I got this horrible musty smell wafted at my face. I don't know if the costume had somehow gotten wet and was sitting in the package getting that musty smell or if it was animal urine, but man did it smell bad. I opened it on Halloween to wear and immediately put it back in the bag and decided not to wear it because the smell was so bad. Beautiful costume though, just wish I had gotten one that didn't smell.

  RECOMMEND! True to size. I had to try this on immediately when it came in. The material is plush, gives the right amount of stretch while still forming to the body, and it’s absolutely comfy. I won’t have to worry about any fabric itchiness, as I was worried about!! The outer piece as well as the hat puff up and take shape as soon as you take them out of the packaging. I plan on wearing this to a Halloween event coming up but it’s so perfect, I know I will rewear it for years to come!! I am so excited to wear this out and do some fun makeup!

  This is NOT a dress & jacket. This is a dress, one piece. It has a belt, a hat, & a bow tie. The jacket is sewn with the "" tank dress"" top part inside. It has a zipper in the back, which starts about 3 inches down from the neck and only goes part way down. you have to put it on over your head. The peplum on the "" jacket"" is stiff, doesnt lay or hang well. The skirt is WAY LONG . But no, this is ALL SEWN TOGETHER.

  Geeat costume & for once ever - actually looks exactly like the picture! The jacket is beautiful & I would have given it 5 stars for the quality/look/ cost balance but there's a chunk of bundled/knotted up black thread from the stitching on the outside of the jacket on the top of the shoulder in plain sight, which is a little disappointing. I'm afraid to alter it, for fear of losing major threading & creating a hole... but it's by no means a deal breaker.

  The only reason I'm not giving this a five star review is because the material on the jacket is a little so so. I believe hanging it out and letting it fall it will look better and I made steam it. But it is a very adorable mad Hatter costume. Fits well on a small to medium frame to 21-year-old. The hat accessory could be a little bigger based on the picture It's a bit smaller than it appears in the picture and is a little flimsy or than I would like. Overall I am satisfied

  The costume was a big hit and I got so many compliments!! Especially on the hat. I'm about 220 lbs and the size XL was just fine! Wasn't tight or too lose in some areas. Originally, I was going to get a plus size version, but after reading previous reviews I decides to go down to the women's XL because I wanted the dress and coat seperately. (In plus size, the coat and dress are connected and you can't take one thing off without taking off the entire outfit.) But I was happy with the XL, even though I had to pull the dress down almost every time I got up from sitting down. I think the only downside was the smell of the packaging it came in. Other than that, I absolutely loved it!

  The pictures and reviews show the dress and jacket as two separate pieces. They are NOT. I bought the 1x-2x size and planned to wear it to teach (all day) on Halloween; with leggings under since it's on the short side. I was glad to have the option to remove the jacket but they are sewn together. There is no back to the dress even if I were to try to separate the two. After trying it on it is a little snug and WARM. Not sure that I can wear it all day. May send back if I can find a better replacement.

  I ordered this costume for a Halloween party I had.  I was concerned because being short and a size 16, costumes often don't fit.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This costume fit fairly well, if anything was just a little big.  But I was ok with that.  I would rather it be a little big than too small.  My only issue was the neckline, it was just a little too low for my taste.  However, you could probably wear a cami under it and fix this.  Know that the skirt area was not fitted.  It was loose on me, which I preferred so I could wear something underneath.  Overall the costume is good quality, I got lots of compliments, and it looks really good on. I would highly recommend this costume.

  Very cute!  Short and sexy but also warm which is great if you are going to be outside at all.  I paired it with tall white boot socks and brown boots. I am 5’4” 125 lbs and am wearing a small.  The only problem is you have to commit to having the hood up to have ears/antlers but then inside you will be too hot in the hood.  So I wore it down & bought a separate headband style set of antlers.

  I usually wear a size Medium, but after reading the other reviews I ordered a size large and it fit great. I am 5'6"" 145 lbs, dress went down to mid thigh. I probably could have gotten away with a medium, but like others have said, it's a little tighter in the waist area, so the large was a safe bet, especially when I layered it with leggings underneath. It's fleece, so it keeps you pretty warm. I got a lot of compliments on it. Would wear/purchase again.

  I bought it because it looked cute, lots of reviews said it was comfortable, and I was tired of doing costumes I wasn't entirely comfortable in. 3 things I learned from purchasing this.1) I bought a size up because I wanted to be super cozy and comfortable. Even doing that, it was a bit tight and I was really disappointed when I first put it on. I was still able to zip it up, even if I felt like a sausage, so I ended up wearing it anyway. I wore some cute makeup to go with it and it made for a cute costume.2) The hooves are not the same fabric as the rest of the costume. They're like a stiff felt? or something? I wore this costume to work and the hooves over my hands made typing an awkward experience, lol. On the plus side, I kept want to hold my hands up and imitate hoof movements.3) This sheds. A lot. I had brown pieces of fabric all over my desk, chair, and floor. I have no idea how this will do after it's washed.

  This is super cute, and like others have said - runs on the small side. I usually wear a small in shirts and this as a medium was a very body contouring fit, and without any stretch. Not a bad thing - but definitely something to keep in mind.Also note that I wore this once, for several hours to a kid's party, and need to wear it to another, and I suspect this material is going to pill... a lot. This is probably not something that you'll get years of use out of.

  This costume is so cute but insanely warm (I live in Arizona so was sweating!). It fit as expected, I got the size small. It does ride up a little bit but nothing crazy! I got a lot of compliments. The hood is hard to keep on so I put two safety pins, one under each antler on the inside, then fastened a Bobby pin into the safety pin then into my hair.

  I would give this product 5 stars for cuteness and quality.  It looks exactly like the picture and it really cute.  Since this is sold as a Women's costume, I have to give it maybe 2-3 stars on the sizing.  My 13yo daughter wears a Juniors L and a Women's S-M.  This Large fit her, but she won't be able to wear thick clothing underneath.  And this was after sending back the Medium that she squeezed into.  The length comes to mid-thigh on her.  Just keep that in mind when ordering.

  Overall, I am pleased with how this costume looks for the money spent. I do think it runs a bit small. I’m 5’8” around 150 pounds, and size 6 in pants, medium in tops. I went with the medium, but wish I’d gone with large. It’s not uncomfortably tight, but I’d prefer it a tad bit looser. It barely covers my bottom, but I was planning on wearing leggings anyway, but for tall girls, not wearing leggings probably wouldn’t be an option. It’s cute, but I might add more white spots, as it needs more, on the back.

  This costume is difficult to correctly state the size. Overall, it was a tight fit in the chest area. However, the sleeves were very long and the hood was huge.

  I bought this twice. The first time the top was too big. The bottom too small. The trim was half ripped off one sleave. There were no straps at all. The zipper on the bottoms unzipped itself constantly. I exchanged for a larger size. It fits perfectly! The sewing job is still cheap and disappointing. The trim was falling off in the the exact same spot. For how much this costs I shouldn't have to repair trim.

  I’m 5’7”, 125lbs and a 34c and a Small fits great! It’s so flattering in all the right places and I can’t wait to wear it! The sleeves tend to slip off my shoulders, but the top comes with clear straps so not a big deal. Buy it! Great quality!

  Just got this in a small for this past halloween weekend. LOVED it and got so many compliments on it! I am 5'3, 125lbs so a small was just fine. The material is stretchy too and slightly high wasted, which was perfect for me when I started getting bloated a few cocktails in lol. Def worth the buy, however beware of the gold stitch detailing to possibly come undone. It did for me by the sleeves by the end of the night.

  I ordered both XS and S and the S is way too big that the top is falling off, the XS is way too small that the elastic won't even stretch enough to allow me to get them so I couldn't even put the top on. Just for reference, I am size 0 or 2 in most brands so I do not know how other girls who wear size 0 or 2 would be able to wear this. It such a shame because I do love it. Just a really bad fit.Also, the S comes with twisted elastic (manufacturer defect)

  The top was huge. Straps continuously were falling off. I'm normally a size small or 2-6, I'm 5'5 and 135 lbs. The pants fit great-but the zipper legit BROKE within an hour of wearing it. I wasn't even sitting, the pants were not tight, it simply was made super cheap and the zipper part just broke. The top stayed zipped with the actual zipper ripped open. Needless to say I had to wear a hoodie over the costume the remainder of the night as I was exposed with the broken zipper. Not happy.

  The costume is as pictured and I think the design is pretty good and creative! I do think that for $50 they could have used nicer material. For example the gold bit around the waist is pretty cheap and flimsy and I don't think it will hold its form for very long. It is a good costume, quality is pretty typical of costumes I think, but it could be a little bit cheaper.

  So I love how sexy this costume is! I’m 5’5 and 139 pounds. Athletic/curvy build, 25.5 inch waist, 36 inch bust, and 38.5 inch hip. Bought a medium, but definitely could’ve gotten the small due to the stretch and extra room in the waist/ having to take the top in. Ended up wearing the pants backwards and purchasing a blue gypsie belt for $6 on Amazon! Ended up making me feel a little more comfortable in the costume :). (I have on the pink belt in the pic bc my blue one wasn’t delivered yet)Anyway, perfect costume if you want to be a little sexy :)

  The costume is super cute but it was very poorly made. The top was a little small, you could see the bottom of my bra and I had to safety pin it down spot wouldn’t show.

  When I tell you that I've never received so many compliments in my life until I wore this costume I'm not lying! This thing is beautiful! For starters I'm 5'5, 150 pounds, with a 36D bust and I ordered a small. The mesh part of the costume stretches, so it wasn't uncomfortably tight or anything! The way the costume sits on my body is like it was made for me and I reallllly love it. I felt super confident and sexy and that's really all you can ask for with a Halloween costume.

   The photo is just a try on. I got the package after dinner and wanted to try it on right away so I have no makeup on and I just put the head piece on over my fro just to get a sense of the overall look.I love everything about this outfit. I saw a review where someone purchased this outfit on sale for $35 so it was a bit hard coughing up $59 for it when I am currently “broke” after reading all the reviews I ordered this in a XS which cost $3 MORE than the small. People putting their measurements and the size costume they ordered really helped me in deciding the size I should order so I will continue on with that helpful trend. In regular clothes I am NOT an extra small but the costume Gives a bit of wiggle room. I am 5/6 in height, 135 lbs, 34a in bra, 27 inches waist, 37hips. The black onesie  underneath was a bit loose, not terrible, but I wish it was skin tight. The outer part fits perfectly. In the photo I am wearing green thong underwear and it’s not visible, you CAN wear underwear with this costume it just have to be high on the hips. When I wear the costume I will obviously be wearing black undies. The costume is quality. I am not wear a bra but will consider wearing one when I officially wear the outfit. The panels/skirt is s but long but that’s something that can be altered to suit your size. By the way.. You can wear the black piece by itself to seduce your hubby into buying another expensive costume next year😉 I hope this review helps someone👍🏿

  Okay so I am an XL and I ordered a medium after reading all the reviews about how the costume runs large.. I have to say I barely squeezed into this thing..lol.. but it does fit!!! If you are a smaller size large you can possibly fit!! Definitely have to wear something underneath it haha if you are thick like me this costume is way too sexy LOL!!!! But the medium is basically for a really thick medium or a size large so if you know that sometimes you can squeeze into a smaller size than this will probably fit.. I took a chance..

  The dress is beautiful in standard and plus sizes. Standard sizes are not great for big/tall girls. I ordered an XL because the reviews say it runs a little large. It fit my bust (40F) snuggly, but not terribly. It was a very “sexy” fit. However, because I’m 6’ tall, the part that hits the standard model on the hips hit me at the waist, above my hips, which looked terrible. I exchanged it for the next size up (1x/2x) which is slightly roomier, as many other reviews said, but is much longer. The cutout is different than the standard sizes and the skirt conceals the legs and hips more.

  I told myself I was going to dress warm and comfortable for Halloween this year and then I came across THIS costume. LOVED IT. and so did everyone else. I went on a bar crawl and so many random girl groups commented on how amazing I looked! Instant confidence booster!Only cons are that the cloth piece that hangs between your legs is loooooong. I’m 5’5” plus I wore 3 inch heels and I was still stepping on it throughout the night. Also, there are two pieces— a stretchy shear gold body suit, and then the black and gold main piece that zips up on the top piece. So going to the bathroom is kind of a big ordeal because you have to get unzipped and THEN get the whole body suit off.....but if you stick to shots you won’t have to pee as much XDI still recommend this outfit if you want to turn heads and slay! It’s bold and unique, I didn’t see anyone else wearing it among all the other sexy cats, cops, and female superheroes.

  i was nervous to order a costume online just because they normally dont fit my body correctly, but the reviews were pretty good so i decided to chance it and order anyways. I actually got lucky and caught it while it was on sale for $36.99 last week:) i can agree with previous reviews that smaller women left. the legs of the bodysuit are a little big but everywhere else fits pretty damn good. I'm 5'7 and about 140 pounds, the small was my best bet. i will note that once you get the body suit up on your shoulders, it does make the bottom look less baggy. i personally think its a bit too revealing not to wear any panties at all so i will be wearing a black or nude thong with mine. overall its a good costume and all my friends love it. cant wait to wear it next week.

  I LOVE THIS COSTUME! 10/10 I'm plus sized and 6ft tall so finding anything especially around Halloween that fits well AND makes me feel hot af is nearly impossible. Ladies and gentlemen, this reached impossible. It fits great and hides all the bits I want hidden while still making me feel sexy and not like I'm being hidden away. Like I said before, I'm 6ft tall and this bitch still has plenty of length left which is a first for me so I'm pumped! I wore 4"" booties with this and still had length. Huge fan, would definitely recommend to the tall girls out there! Can not stress enough how happy I am with this costume.

  This costume is confusing. the under body suit is poorly made, the seam is so large and noticeable which is weird and on an XS its almost like a large. its baggy and makes no sense. then you have the other part of the costume which is awesome but theoretically unusable unless you can find another sheer body suit i am not happy with spending this money on a ""half good"" costume.

  I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of this costume. It's pretty comfortable, it's figure flattering and I like that it came with a head piece and the sleeves have gold cuffs so you really don't need to add any kind of bracelet jewlery. My only complaint is that the jeweled neck part doesn't lay flat, it kind of bubbles up in the center but it's not really a big deal. The dress is super long but that's an easy fix imo. All in all, for the price and fit I'm pretty excited to wear it!

  This costume is ultra sexy and very comfy. I wore a black thong with it as the back has just enough material to cover half of both cheeks. The front and back are the same except the backside has a little more coverage. I tend to be on the thicker side and the material was stretchy enough to be comfortable. I did have to cut the skirt in the front and back as these costumes are usually made for women who are taller. I am 5’3 and 165 lbs. It looked amazing!

  I liked this costume but I thought the medium was really too big.  I wore this to the New York Halloween parade which was outdoors in cold weather and I had ample room to wear three full body suits inside. The sleeves and legs were still wrinkly though. I'm 5'3"" and 109 lbs - I usually like to wear my clothes a bit loose and so prefer a size medium but for this kind of costume I guess you need it to fit exactly right - that was my mistake. The costume itself was pretty. I jazzed it up with wings and despite all the elaborate costumes at the parade mine stood out a little bit too!

  Love everything about this costume except no crotch opening in the body suit. They could make a velcro flap or something or a 2 piece underlayer. But I wore the body suit anyway and cut an opening in the crotch since I wouldn't be able to remove the whole costume to go to the bathroom. I liked the metallic aspect of the body suit. Someone could wear nothing or leggings instead of the body suit but I liked how it looked so I dealt with it. Otherwise would have been 5 stars!.

  Super late review,  but better late than never. I bought this costume for a Halloween party. It was part of a couple costume,  my husband being Marc Antony.  I was looking for something sexy but not too revealing.  This definitely fit the bill. I loved the body stocking except for no hole to pee! That definitely posed a problem while drinking.  It was also pretty warm while dancing, but then again I live in SoCal so it could be that too. By the end of the night I had taken off the stocking and left the overdress on . As a large busted woman, I was worried about the boob situation.  Ladies, if you are large chested invest in some boob tape otherwise you will see ANY type of bra you put on. Believe me,  I tried my whole arsenal. Those slits by the way, wow. They started at my waist! I will admit that it flared gorgeously while I walked. When I wasn't almost tripping on the extra length. Lol High heels would have worked better but I used flat sandals. For reference  I am a 5 foot 7 inch, 200 lb hourglass shaped woman.

  This product is quite modest, but beautiful and  sexy. The quality is very good.  It's designed for a standard figure, which is not quite what I have. Initially, I had bought MEDIUM - my regular size - but it ran too large, so I had to reorder a small size. But I am a full figure, so it was not quite a fit,as I am bigger in chest that the small size and a little thinner is waist than the medium I had before.  But hopefully,  it stretches and I managed to slip in it, and it looks good to me. I recommend this costume for special occasions , such as Halloween or any costumed party.

  Loved it ! I’m a 34DD and I weigh about 125 pounds and am 5’1”. Wore no bra; perfect fit everywhere! The gold one piece to wear under the costume is a bit loose, then again it seems kinda like a one size fits all kinda thing, or at least is loose enough for range of sizes and body types. It’s a great option to wear with the costume and really compliments the gold color! It would have been really hot for me and the outside Halloween event I attended. This costume is versatile in the sense where you can maybe wear shorts under or, like in my case, wear fishnet stockings. Maybe all black pantyhose. I feel as though you can really make the look with this costume how you want it and feel comfortable! My only advice is to properly measure the black fabric that hangs in the front and back with the shoes you will wear with the costume. I wore heels and it was still dragging on the floor. I should have cut it beforehand. But oh my god I love this costume and you will too! And by the way I ordered this the day before Halloween and paid shipping to receive on Halloween and received it between 12-1 pm mid day of Halloween! Super quick shipping and just awesome !

Also don’t let’s the sexy pictures fool you. The bigger the size the more fabric they add. The cut out part In the front is almost none existent and the sexy slits in the front are hidden by so much fabric you would have to pin it all back to even see any leg. I’m not a short girl and this was so long it could be a wedding train. Ugh I wanted to love this so bad

  Okay if your trying to decide which Egyptian costume to choose from YOU FOUND THE PERFECT ONE. I just received mine in the mail and omg I’m so glad I decided to get it. Absolutely beautiful (and sexy as hell) the headpiece is also very good quality. So happy I listened to other reviews. I’m usually a large, but the under bodysuit stretches And it stretches perfectly around all the right areas. So I got a medium. (I’m 5’8, roughly around 180lbs) If your more on the conservative side then I suggest wearing A high Black thong/booty shorts, Your booty and female part is definitely out there (but covered). Other than I’m so excited to wear this for Halloween!

  Love this costume. Talk about classy without being slutty! Its beautiful. However, the gold body cat-suit was way too big for me. I'm 5'9"", 115 lbs. The leg part was loose as it comes. I didn't want to return it, so I took the body suit to get altered by seamstress. I'm hoping she was able to fix it. Once I get it, I'm going to buy a beautiful head piece to wear with my wig.

  Listen to the reviews for sizing. Go a size down. Unfortunately mine came with the head piece missing  and it looks like I got someone's  return but it's  quality made it easier for me to just wash it and keep it than returning it.

  Amazing costume, a lot of compliments the whole night , the only thing is the gold jumpsuit was too big for a XS size other than that the costume it's absolutely beautiful, be sure wear underwear under the suit and on top just in case, mine was the cheeky/ cheeky from Victoria secret in black and it was looking like part of the costume . I also wear rubber bands on my ankles because the suit was too long for me , I'm 5'2"" , 110 pounds and size 34DD , pant size 3 and the XS was perfect for me. Also I used a black elastic connecting the bottom to the front part under the zipper part ( Inside the costume , like a thong) because it's was too open so the elastic closed the costume a little bit and don't move for the whole night . So happy with this costume , eyes all over me the whole night.

  I loved the look of this costume. It is a little revealing but that made me feel really sexy wearing it. The thickness of the bodysuit was perfect, not too thick and not too thin. For those ladies that are large chested, you are still able to be accommodated. The only problem I had was finding underwear that were cut high enough on the sides so you couldn’t see them.  Great value for the money. I definitely recommend this costume.

  The product was perfect for the Halloween party I went to. It fit well, there are three pieces. The first one is a bodysuit that is sheer gold. You can flip it inside out and make it all black. The second piece fits a little higher. I thought it would be more on my hips, but it is more around the wait which means you show a lot of leg on the side. This was fine, i just could not wear anything underneath the body suit. Third piece was the headress, I have to say I bought my own one of these and ended up with the one from the costume. It kept my wig in place better and made it not as fluffy. Will definitely wear it again.

  The costume was very nice for the price I paid for it and other places had it for double the price. It fit true to size the only issue I had with it was that it was too long in length. I had to cut it. But I’m only 5’3 so that’s expected I’m a short woman. I also appreciated that the bottom part of the dress was not that skimpy it had enough fabric to cover me enough, not like the smaller sizes that barely had anything to cover the bottom part of the out fit. Mines was plus size.

  I will be returning this item but not because I don't like it. Simply because I took a chance and it was too big :(, I ordered the 3x/4x and it doesn't fit my size 18 frame. I believe the length doesn't work either because it's swimming on top. I would have been more comfortable with the 1x/2x however they were sold out. If you are looking to purchase this item and are on the fence, DO IT! It's a beautiful costume. My only gripe (and the reason it is 4 stars instead of 5) is the material and sheerness of the body suit that accompanies the costume. Beware as it is literally see through. While most of the body suit is covered by the costume, if a strong wind blows - your entire backside will be exposed. Honestly - beautiful costume for plus size females!!! I look forward to ordering something else from Leg Avenue in the future.

  For the cost of this product (not cheap) I expected more than what I received. The stripes which are beautifully lined up on the model are not lined up on the actual dress that I received. This makes the dress look weird to anyone who has any eye for detail, style or good taste. The fit of the dress is ok. It is too long by many inches, even in heels. The body suit could be tighter and stretchier. It’s too late to return, so hopefully in dim lighting both my dress and I will look fabulous. Ha.

The body suit was a perfect fit (I’m 5’8” 130lbs and I bought a small) the dress was a little short in the torso but I tend to have this issue with most dresses. Was a slight challenge figuring out what to wear on the bottom so that I didnt have underwear showing and didn’t accidentally expose myself... I ended up wearing some nude pantyhose under the body suit that were opaque at the top. Worked out well.Oh, also...

  I shopped around (at Halloween costume stores and online) and this is by far the best deal for the price. You get a hat, shirt, long socks, and a one-piece shorts/suspenders). Quality is right where it should be. A Large fit me fine at 5'8"" 175 lbs (although I do prefer clothes slightly loose, Medium would've probably been a little tight, but that's my personal taste). The straps are adjustable for those graced with more height than me. You'll probably have to safety pin them in place (no biggie as they slide around, but women have been dealing with that for centuries). And the pant waist expands (luckily because I'm a 36"" maybe 37"" as I've started to put on my ""winter coat"" for the the colder season in the north east). Hat came a little smushed, but I put some paper inside it to pop it back out for when I'm ready. I have a pretty large head and it fits fine. ***For all those haters out there who give poor reviews and are expecting an actual Oktoberfest high-quality premium outfit (not a costume), go spend the $100-120 for the real deal and go cosplay. For those whose who like to have fun and will get some laughs at parties, not to mention multiple years out of a pretty well made product, this is for you. Happy Oktoberfest-ing!

   The quality of the material on every piece of the costume is  impressive for $30. The sizing though, is way off. I got a Large but it definitely feels like an XL if not XXL. I am 6'3 and 185lbs. The shoulder straps I have tightened all the way to shortest notch and they are still too loose. I cut an extra hole in the straps to make it tighter. The waist is huge as well. Im wear a 32 or 33 and it feels like I have a 36 on that could probably stretch to a 42 if needed.

  I give this item 4 stars because it is actually a pretty good costume for the money. Two things to keep in mind... 1) It is definitely ""costume quality"". Don't buy this if you're headed to Munich and don't expect to use it over and over. 2) It runs big. I punched an extra hole in the suspenders to tighten it up a bit more than the factory adjustments allowed and still had to frequently slide the straps back over my shoulders. But for the price, it worked out fine. Our first Oktoberfest party was a success, so I imagine I'll invest in a better set for the future.

  Me: Hey hun, me and your son are going to be Goldilocks and baby bear for Halloween! You should get a costume that matched the theme! (Thinking he would go as a bear, a bowl of porridge or a rocking chair)Him: Say no more ! I have the perfect costume.- Amazon package arrives two days later and I open it before he comes home...Me (thinking to myself)- Ahh yes , Goldilocks baby bear and the German Pimp. A childhood classic.** While I’m not thrilled with him I will say this costume is absolutely perfect, came in great condition, sized accurately in my opinion (I am a five foot tall woman though but I had a blast modeling the costume to send him preview pictures lol) . It also fits my six foot tall husband. He wears XL-2XL and it fits him perfectly. The hat really adds a certain sense of perfection to the costume especially the red feather. Great costume if you don’t have a picky wife or are going to a beer fest or just want a giggle !

  I got an XL which lists size 42 waist as it's upper range. I wear 44 normally and have no problem fitting into this. I would think a 46 might fit into them as well, but I can't guarantee it. I'm 6'5"" and about 290 lbs and overall the fit is good. The shirt is short for my height but stays tucked into the lederhosen decently. Like everyone else says, the suspenders are way too long even at my height. Just did a quick fix with safety pins to tighten it up.The quality is better than I expected for the price. It's obvious that it's a costume, but probably one of the best made costumes I've bought over the years.

  My husband is 6'1, 180lbs and bought a medium. He probably would've fit better in a small. We crisscrossed the straps in back because they were really long. The shorts were baggy, but that didn't really bug him. He bought different socks because the ones that came with it were thigh highs. Costume also looked great without the white shirt, but he ended up with nipple chaffing by the end of the night, lol. Despite the costume not fitting perfectly, he got a million compliments on his costume. Definitely worth the money.

  So... I bought this before studying abroad thinking it would be fine to wear to the real Oktoberfest in Munich. Well... two things happened: First, I was kicked out of one of the venues because I wasn’t supposed to wear a cut-rate costume. I should have just splurged on a real leather lederhosen. Second, some German friends we made later on told me it looked hideous and that I was better off just removing it entirely, which I did. It might be good for parties in the US or other Oktoberfest parties, but not in Munich!!!

  This costume doesnt really stay on. There is no way to tighten the straps and keep them tightened. The buckle allows them to be tightened at the top but then you go to pull the strap down and it can't be pulled down as it is sewed. Very odd design. The shirt is also very flimsy. But works as a costume for one day. Also never received the socks for the costume.

  The fact that it comes with everything, including the hat and socks ( Socks not pictured as they were white and they wanted to wear dark) for the price was good. It was a good option for Octoberfest activities. The straps were long but if you CROSS them in the back it fits better. Had to do a little pinning of the straps at the waistline in the front.

  ...which is just about right for Halloween. I had a comfortable evening at a Halloween party, it looked like an okay costume. The hat is too small for an adult human male. The liederhosen are made for someone who is about as tall as me and weights 700 lbs. The shirt fits pretty well, though. The socks are ridiculous. Don't bother with them. Despite all that, it looked pretty good. Nobody even accused me of trying to culturally appropriate Germans.

  Ordered 7 and they were not all the same. Some had adjustable straps and some didn't. Even the ones with adjustable straps were WAY TOO LONG! I had to take almost six inches from each strap. Also was not a fan that the sleeves did not have a button close the sleeve cuff, going to have to sew buttons or velcro in to all 7 costumes... Once the alterations are made and they are pressed, the costume has a pretty authentic look to it... as long as you don't get too close. :)

  This thing is awesome! If you're 7 feet you'll fit in this costume. Tons of height room available. No way to use your hands unless you stick them out the zipper. Was not a problem for me. You can still kinda grab things with them in the fins.I used this in the pouring rain in Milwaukee this past Halloween. I was soaked in 10 minutes. This is not waterproof. No matter. It stayed inflated. Everyone we met loved it and it was hilarious trying to find big puddles to stomp around in and dance around like a fool. And yes, more than one kid threw the baby shark song my way. A total blast!! My girlfriend just rolled her eyes but it didn't matter since I couldn't see her because the window was all fogged up. Lol!The material is pretty tough. It took a beating when all my nephews and nieces had to try it on before halloween. No tears or rips to speak of. I will probably be using it next year as well. It was too much fun not to.Get it!

  I’m an avid shark week fan, Initially I was looking for a shark costume that was so realistic that I could actually bite people with but I found that was frowned upon after my last cease and desist order so I opted for the more safer option which was a blowup one and then proceeded to go out my daily routine wearing this costume out and about: walking my dog, saying hello to my neighbors, grocery shopping, and thus fourth. I will proceed to wear this costume until my time here is done.

  I was super skeptical at first, because this one was cheaper than the others listed. But, gonna be honest I love it!! It's so great haha. I'm 5' 11"", and it fits great!! Honestly I feel a couple inches too short for it, but once I put my arms in the sleeves then it adjusts and fits perfectly. Plus, any extra height is made up for in the legs :) OH! And I can wear shoes with this, which I thought was a super cool touch. The only thing I'd say is, make sure to pack an extra set of batteries. It seems to burn power somewhat quickly, but 4 batteries seems to have lasted me quite a while still :)Super happy with this purchase!! Would 10/10 buy this again.

  So, all in all it was well received. Lots of laughs. A couple of main points:1. You’d think it’s clear that you’re mocking the president, but it’s not. So a couple people were upset with me because they assumed I was pro-Trump. Which leads to...2. You’ve now invited political conversation on yourself for the entirety of the evening. Maybe that’s your thing, just be prepared.Even with all the laughs there’s a much larger downside: drunk men LOVE to punch trump in the face. Like, this alone will lead to fighting. I almost punched back after being hit in the balls for a second time. I also had drunk guys grab his head and force it into their crotch. Trumps head is basically one big target sitting just above your balls. Wear a cup, and be ready to brawl.Other than that, great costume!

  Ordered the president piggy backSize was fine- I am 5'2"" and had to pin up the bottom of his jacket so you could see his legs and also had to pin up some of the inside or else the crotch of the pants was so low I couldn't walk. I wish there was at least 2 height options on these.Complaint: the head is made of rubber and is so heavy it droops down. I had to keep pulling it up so people could tell who it was ( myou can see in pictures). If the head had been placed better or made of fabric it would have stayed looking upright much better.All this said- it was a really funny costume and I loved it. Would I order again? Not unless is it a fabric head.

  Was very happy to get this in the 2 days as promised, but was disappointed that I got a damaged one.. also it was absolutely saturated with all those little white strings all over it.. i didnt mind having to stuff the legs but sew the waistband and clean the linty white stuff off of the whole thing inside and out? Will probably just return it.. spend the extra $15 and get a new one with no rips and is clean.

  Laughter guaranteed!  I am a very petite female (5'2, 95 lbs) so I expected this to be somewhat large. I've ordered another morph costume from this brand before, and with both suits, I have had to bobby pin the head closer to the waistband to prevent drooping. Unlike the other morph costume, this one requires you to use your own stuffing. I used crumpled up newspaper and it worked just fine, however, prepare for lots of paper crunching noise when walking around!In my opinion, one disappointing flaw was the way that the oompa loompa's ""hair"" is attached to the plush head. No matter what I did, the hair would fall towards the front, completely covering the character's face.Despite how funny this costume is, I am giving this three stars because the quality is significantly lower than the other morph costume made by the same brand. I've included a picture for reference: I am Willy Wonka riding an oompa loompa, and my cat was my Wonka bar!

  EDIT: Customer service reached out and was very polite and helpful. The agreed to fix the issue with their recent change in design and apologized for the delay in updating the product images to reflect the new design.Original: I like the costume, I bought the alien. However, when I placed the order the picture showed the alien wearing a silver suit that said Area 51 on it. The costume I received just has a green alien. My order page shows the alien wearing the silver suit but now the photo on the sellers page has changed.  Disappointed as I was expecting the item shown when I ordered the costume and having the suit that said Area 51 was important to the theme I needed the costume for. Overall the costume is still fun and will be used.

  It was a great costume. The only bummer is we thought it came stuffed but it didn’t, so we just used the airbags from other packing boxes to fill it. That worked great because it didn’t make it too hot and it was just enough to fill it in the right way. It was a little loose around the waist once we stuffed it, it kind of made it sag on him a little but it didn’t fall so it was okay. The head is the only part that stuffed. And of course there were the inappropriate jokes about where the nose is. Ha ha.

  Got a lot of compliments on this costume, that will also be my ugly sweater costume. It's cheap material, but it really is a cute costume.

  I had tried this on when I got it in the mail. It seemed fine. Well today, on Halloween, I put it on, it seemed fine, and literally walked around in it for 20 minutes until all of the seams were falling apart, the material was”running”I was so upset that I just took it off.

  Very cheap material to say the least, definitely will NOT fit up to what it says and I'm 2 sizes smaller than what they said they would fit in the waist and that's VERY disappointing. Comes completely crushed (the head) inside the bag and when you try to re-form the head and arms to make it look somewhat presentable it still looks lame and all distorted, AND I didn't even get to the ""stuff your own legs part yet""!

  I knew this costume would be too small when I ordered it. But with some modifications, and a pair of sweatpants, I got it working. It looks funny in back, but the front blends well. TIP: Stuff the legs with reusable heavy-duty plastic bags from the grocery store. I used a bunch from Food-4-Less (about $4 worth @ $0.10 ea.) They are light, firm, and bulky. Bubble wrap may be better, but is expensive.

  I wore this costume for SantaCon (bar crawl). It's suggested to fill legs and Santa hat with newspaper. I used plastic grocery bags which looked more natural than bumpy/noisy newspaper. I also had to safetypin the Santa hat to my sweater to keep his head upright. Not a problem until I had to remember to unhook to use the bathroom. Costume was a hit overall.

  The ""human legs"" don't come with any pattern.  I was expecting to have to find some stuffing to finish the costume, but this looks like two black legs just dangling in the air.  I didn't even wear them because the costume doesn't make sense.  Maybe if I have an old worn pair of jeans next year I'll stitch them on and find some beat up sneakers to put on them, but this costume was a complete waste of money.

  My wife and I ordered this Mario costume (size Small 4-6) for our 5-year-old little boy and overall we like the costume but are disappointed by how cheaply made the product is. If your child is particularly rambunctious or rough on clothing this costume is almost guaranteed to tear due to the absolute bottom-tier materials.This Mario costume consists of the distinctive blue coveralls and red shirt which is really just one large jumpsuit with an opening at the back to slide the entire costume on. The back is secured by Velcro strips. Also included with this costume are the red 'M' Mario hat and mustache. Oddly, the distinctive white gloves are missing. We ordered my younger son the matching Luigi costume from the same brand and it comes with the gloves but no mustache, which again, is just a bit strange.The materials used in each of the components is 100% Polyester. My son loved his costume but as a parent, I dislike the cheap materials which really do a disservice to the Nintendo brand. The costume also runs incredibly hot. On a chilly Halloween night, both my sons were drenched with sweat from running around with these costumes on. Word of warning if you live in warmer climates.This product speaks to our throw-away culture and is really not built to last more than a single season. My son is a fan and the costume is cute and definitely fits the Mario character. However, carefully consider how your child will use the costume before ordering. If you're expecting a long life or repeated use this is not the costume to order.

  My son loves this costume! He tried to wear it multiple times before Halloween. On Halloween, he pretty much wore it all day, to school and trick-or-treating. It was comfortable for him to walk around in and the mustache wasn't annoying to wear at all. He also received plenty of compliments.

  My four year old loves this costume. It is a little long for him (I bought a slightly larger size), and the mustache only really sticks on for one wear. I didn’t use the whole sticky back the first time, so he did get more than one use out of it. Material is thin, so he wears his clothes under it and it fits fine.Hat is a little big, but soft.

  The quality is not great, but is in line with most modern Halloween outfits. THe mustache is single use - has one cut to size double sided adhesive that you stick on. So once you take it off it will stick to itself, and it's not sturdy enough to untangle without damage. I put it onto a plastic paper cover and used glue dots the second time he wore it.

  Adorable costume, as long as you only intend to use it once or twice. If you wash it once (even hand washing), it literally falls apart. The mustache is huge for a kid's face, so we had to cut it back, but it was SO cute. The hat lasts longer than the rest of the outfit. The whole thing runs VERY small. Order at least 1 size larger than you think you need. Also is extremely thin- child will need to wear shirt/pants underneath. Especially if it's cold outside.

  Mio figlio era felicissimo, il costume è carino, anche se abbiamo dovuto rammendarlo dopo che è stato usato una sola volta perché sì è fatta una smagliatura (tipo quando si tirano le collant) proprio sul collo, per questo ho dato 4 stelle.

  Das kostüm passt meinem 5 jährigen Sohn soweit gut, jedoch ist die dazu gehörige Mütze eine Katastrophe. Die bestellte Größe 116-122 entspricht aber nicht die Mütze, die ist mir als Erwachsene schon fast zu gross, jetzt muss ich seperat eine andere Mütze bestellen und noch extra drauf zahlen. Obwohl das bestellte Set mit 30 Euro nicht grad günstig ist dafür das die Mütze nicht zu gebrauchen ist. Schade...

  Bought this for my 12yo son, who typically wears an adult small, and was happy to find it was a great fit. The belt fits but is on the smaller side. The cape, hood & vest are all one piece, easy to wear & heavy duty material. Pants are elastic waist & light weight.He loved it, said it was his best costume yet. I agree, it is great. Good quality, the accessories are fun, arrived quickly & the price was spot on.

We ordered and expected that what is in the picture is exactly the same we'll get.We were amazed that we got what we saw in the picture. My boyfriend loves the quality of the material used. It isn't cheap leather but not an expensive one either. This is definitely worth recommending to guys who want to be Robin Hood on Halloween.

  Totally disappointed in this costume. I'm, first of all a guy who uses his wife's Amazon account, thus the name. I'm 5'7"", 180. I wear a 34"" in pants. I bought a large, which is supposed to fit 37""-39"" waist. This is an awful costume. I was encouraged by the one photo that was posted of somebody in action in this costume. Made it look like a steal.The top was a bit oversized and the leather part -- which is most of the front of the top -- is cheap, cheap plastic. Stiff, doesn't move great. It looked and felt awful to wear. The pants, which were supposed to fit a guy who is 39"" are too small for a guy who's a 34"". The belt did not even fit all the way around me and, because it's Velcro, would not stay on even when forced.The 2-star rating is only elevated by the fact that it comes with a lot of chintzy accessories. The hood was pretty cool. I didn't even bother with the gloves but they looked huge, so that was a NOPE. There's a lot to this costume for the price they're asking. It would be a better costume if they cut half of the crap out and actually concentrated on making it a worthwhile purchase. Instead, it's an unusable costume because I'd say the top is an XL and the bottoms and belt are a S/M. This is going back. I spent $10 *more* but got a better costume at Spirit Halloween, which I was able to try on in-store.

  Awesome costume! Just got it in the mail and immediately my husband tried it on. Such great quality for the price, I was very surprised. The fit is a bit weird, the top back half is a different material, great for stretching. But the top is slightly bulky, if you're slimmer definitely size down but it'll be an easy fix with some safety pins. The pants are scrunched up a bit on the sides and seem to fit a bit snug which is totally fine but looks a lil off with the top being bulky, again easy fix. It came with everything, the gloves are very tight and the seam already started spreading in between the fingers but I'm sure that was my husband's big hands fault. Overall great great costume, im super happy with it and so is he.

  I'm 5'9"", 200 lbs, medium build, 46 chest, 38 waist and bought the size LARGE, which fits great, except for the belt (velcro connect) which is about 3 inches too short!

  The XL belt is too small for me, I'm a 36"" waist, but it's too ugly for me to care. It's probably a 30"" belt. I wear a medium glove and my thumbs didn't touch the end. I'll probably cut them down. Everything else fits great. I wear an XL shirt and L pants, so you can get an idea of my fit. The bucket on the quiver belt is plastic, but looks better than the waist belt.All you need is a bow, arrows, quiver and boots, and a belt if you want something nicer or it doesn't fit. Add a wig if you need longer hair.I was going for a Legolas look, because the LotR outfits weren't as complete.

  This costume was better than I expected considering the price.  The main piece is well constructed and nice quality.  I'm 5' 6"" 155 lb. with a slim build so I purchased a size Medium and it was a little large for me.  I'm just going to pin it in the back to make it work since I'm worried the Small may be too small for me.  This would have been a 5-star costume if the accessories weren't so cheap.  My first attempt to try on the right glove resulted in rip between the thumb and index finger, and I have small slender hands.  I put on the left glove on more gingerly but the glove didn't fit right at all.  As gloves, they were pretty useless so I cut the hand part of the gloves off and I'm just using the cuff parts on my forearms.  The belt for around my 32"" waist was surprisingly too small considering how large the costume fit so I'm not using the waist belt at all.  There's a second belt that goes over the upper chest that I really couldn't figure out how to put on but it seemed that it would cover the best features of the main piece.  I was able to modify this belt by cutting the shoulder strap and using the longer part of the belt around my waist, which I felt looked better than that cheap belt that was supplied for the waist in the first place.  The leg pieces were well constructed but very tight on my slender legs.  I just had to make a slight modification on the bottom to make them work with the only pair of brown shoes that I owned.  Overall I'm happy with the costume and can't wait to wear it for this year's costume party.

  First thing I need to address is the only reason I gave this two stars is that it's actually really nice looking. But that's pretty much all it's got going for it. The main piece tha you put over your head and has the robe on it fits, but everything else is extremely small and does not stretch or fit! Now I got an XL to really make sure it fits even though according to the sizing I'm a large, and it's still way too freaking small! Boot covers, belt, and gloves did not fit at all.

  If i can edit the post to include a better photo later i will but for now i just want to say it’s probably top of the line for the price (40 dollars after tax probably wouldn’t pay more than that) and i got mine exactly when delivery was predicted the day before halloween. On the subject of the costume itself, the hood is a tad big but as you can see i managed to just put it on partially the pants are nothing special just some cheap black thin sweatpants, really like the torso on it although the cheap fake leather while somewhat convincing isn’t easily moved. The biggest issue i have with it is that the bootstraps are made of the same cheap leather material and although they look cool are 100% not going over my calfs and even if i did get them over would cause tearing. The gloves were on the opposite end of the spectrum and my fingers couldn’t go all the way through. All in all i’m giving it 4 stars because i’ve seen significantly worse costumes for significantly more money

  Although the costume looks decent, in terms of details, etc., the color looks pretty off, in terms of the photo at Amazon. In the photo, it looks like a more olive drab, but in actuality, it's a more bright, almost kelly green. That color mismatch ensured that it wasn't what my son was looking for (hard to look like a cool, stealthy ranger-type, when you're the color of the Lucky Charms leprechaun).

  This is a very nice costume.  I bought a small men size for my 11 year old and it turned great.  He’s really an 18-20 in youth...basically a teen in between kids sizes and adult.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because one of the gloves only had 4 finger holes.  So we couldn’t use the gloves.

  The costume arrived on time. It looked great! My son was very happy with it. I would have given 5 stars, however the costume came with 2 right-hand gloves rather than one for each appropriate hand, and the stitching came apart immediately for one of them. Otherwise, again, this was a great costume!

  Bought it for a quick and cheap Halloween costume for work. According to the guidelines, I should just perfectly be an XL. However, the belt was way too small and the gloves were somewhat awkward fitting. However, the main bulk of the costume fit nicely and looked really good, given the pricetag. The costume can get pretty hot however.

  I'm giving it a 2-star because they increased the price almost $5 when I processed a return and reship.  I purchased a medium per the online chart  however it was  to small.  Overall the costume is a good choice.  The vest fits a little different (bulky) and might require some modification.  The gloves are vinyl and fit a little bulky too, making it difficult to handle things.  I would still recommend the costume.  I'm just a little bitter the seller increased the purchase price to cover the shipping cost.

  I bought this for my 10 year old son for his Halloween costume and this was hands down, my greatest (sober) Amazon purchase of all time. He's just shy of the 5 ft mark but it fit him perfectly, with plenty of room to grow. I even wore it to my job (a bank) on Halloween as the office dressed up, and we had clients, coworkers, and even our HR department in hysterics. The only real negatives I noticed (and these are all fairly minor) about this costume is that the battery pack requires a tiny screwdriver (I brought one to work lol), the ventilation in the costume is non-existent (yes, I know it has to be to keep it inflated), and that the batteries die fairly quickly; though I'm sure that could be debatable based on the battery brand used.Now my son and his best friend decided that they were going to terrorize the neighborhood as dinosaurs and his friend got the kids costume (where your face is exposed in the neck of the suit). His friend kept his on ALL night as the ventilation was perfect, but my son would constantly unzip his and walk with his face out - thus ruining the full effect. They ran around for HOURS and we did not notice any wear-and-tear on the tails from the asphalt or rough grounds. They hands down took the neighborhood's 'popular vote' in best costume and had many adults in literal tears as they watched them run up their driveways.This costume is definitely a humorous investment and has been worn numerous times since Halloween. Our dogs hate it, my cat is totally sketched out by it, and my son thinks it's the greatest thing since the X-box One came out.(Also, here's a video of the boys as they approach one house - you can hear the adults losing their minds over the costumes :)[...]

  If you're on the big & tall side like myself, you're probabaly hesitant to purchase this, especially since Halloween costumes historically run small. (I know I was!) however let me assure you that it does fit me just fine, and I even had some room to spare.That being said, The legs and arms have an elastic on them to keep the air in. This can be rather tight depending on how large your ankles/wrists are.Getting into the costume wasn't too bad at all; I was expecting much worse due to reading the other reviews. If I can do it being 6'2, I'm not sure what others were doing wrong. Here's what I did to get it on quickly and easily:-Lay costume on floor, zipper facing up-Insert legs into each leg opening-Crouch into a ball (hugging your knees)-CAREFULLY bring the costume up over your head-Once fully inside, ensure fan is on, and zip up-Finally, put hands through arm holes(Same process in reverse to take it off)Lastly, I will confirm what others have stated. It gets hot inside. Very hot. I only wore the costume for 5 minutes to test, and I was already sweating. Hopefully this won't be an issue since it will be colder in October.The costume seems to be well made, and all parts were included.Please excuse the poor picture - due to the Trex having short arms, they are inherently bad at taking selfies.If this was helpful, give a thumbs up. :)

  I got this coatume as a birthday gift for my friend who is a huge attention monger. Of course he went nuts for it and immediate started wearing it everywhere.  He loves it.  Too much.  He wants to wear it all the time and everywhere and if constantly harassing me to try to come up with new and attention grabbing things he can do in the costume.  He had been skateboarding, bowling, rode a mechanical bull, ice skating, etc.  the costume is pretty durable. But highly annoying to ME.  Here are the pros: decent battery life.  He's been in it for a constant 9 hrs with no loss of battery.  Warm which is nice for cool climates.  Children LOVE it.  So do adults.  Not easy to rip or tear.Cons: you will be stopped for photos every fewMinutes.  Not asked for them, but literally yelled at, grabbed and harassed for photos by ADULTS WANTING SELFIES.

  It has got to be the goofiest looking things when you start walking in it, the head flops back and you end up looking like an overly excited toddler. I saw a video of someone wearing this costume re-enacting a Jurassic Park scene on YouTube, and right then, I knew I had to have it. Putting the costume on for the first time was a bit of a challenge. you have to put your head and arms in first, and then put your legs in. Only complaint, my wife is leaving me because I haven't taken it off for 3 weeks now.

  Received the product and when I opened it I noticed it was in a return bag, meaning someone else bought this exact one and returned it. Guess I know why, the zipper is completely broken! What the hell?! You can see where someone tried to get it back on the track because there are frayed pieces of thread and the zipper is stretched out so it wouldn’t even fit on there anyway. Do you not check your returned items when they are shipped back or do you just repackage them and get them back into your inventory?! This product will not work unless you can zip it up! Extremely disappointed as I needed this costume for a birthday party this weekend. Ugh, do better.

  Hello,I am not sure if I'm on the right forum or not but..here goes:My name is Bernie, I'm a single Tyrannosaurus Rex of the Theropod family originally from Laramidia or what you might know as the Western U.S. region. My parents were Malcolm and Tricia Bones originally from Gondwana (I'm first generation) who were both professional dancers however my father was banished from Gondwana after accidentally squishing the High Order King's daughter Linda during a Carnivore's Ball when he was 29. Well...anyway I still live pretty close to them and we raid a farm or city bus every other week for a meal and to catch up.Currently I'm working at a small seasonal theme park that operates spring through fall. My job is to scare customers without harming or eating them and occasionally do some landscaping however with my short arms I find it really hard to do anything involving any general lifting or pulling movements. In the winters I dress up as a reindeer at Malls but am required to stay perfectly still. My boss used to send me to schools but I'm not allowed within 50 feet after the last ""running incident"" where I ate about a dozen school children after I sneezed and they realized I was real....It isn't my fault it is in my blood to chase...Anyway I love cats, large mammal bones, going for a jog in the park, and I'm very in to history particularly Late Cretaceous periods discussing the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and theories involved....I""m a nice enough guy honestly I'm just looking for a she-Rex that is pretty, likes humble guys, and enjoys a quiet evening in a cave gnawing on bones watching re--runs of the TV series Dinosaurs...Man was that show great!Please call me, don't text I really can't use my fingers or even pick up my phone most of the time....

  So I bought three of these because when you're in lockdown, why the heck not?  Seriously, convincing my two kids (10 and 12) to join me in inflatable dinosaur costumes took a bit of effort. ""Mom, it's not even CLOSE to Halloween yet!""  However, once they were in the suits, they completely embraced their inner T-Rexes!These are so easy to put on, zip up, and inflate.  I was concerned that my smaller 10-year-old son would have trouble seeing out of it, but he reported that he could see just fine.  There is clear vinyl just under the throat as well as under the chin for taller individuals.  We all had the BEST time walking around the neighborhood in these!  Even the neighbors and their kids came outside to see us.  We made lots of people laugh who drove by.I had a difficult time moving around in my costume, but it was only because I was laughing so hard at watching my two dino-kids run down the street ahead of me.  Our afternoon as a T-Rex family was one of the best days we've had in a long time.

   This inflatable dinosaur costume is awesome!  I  absolutely love it!  Our whole family has had fun, chasing each other around in it, dancing, surprising delivery people, and lots of other silly stuff. The fed ex delivery guy had a good laugh and said it made his day when a T-Rex opened the door. He said he’s seen a lot of strange stuff while making deliveries, but it was the first time he’s ever delivered a package to a dinosaur. It’s hard not to have fun wearing this costume. It fit everyone from my daughter who is 5’2” tall to my husband who is 6’ tall. There were only a few features that I wasn’t crazy about, but they were definitely out numbered by the positive features and sheer fun of the costume. The arms are short and they are at an awkward height, but that’s just T-Rex anatomy.  The “mittens” fit well and when tucked into the elastic on the end of the sleeves, they stayed on well. I found the costume surprisingly comfortable and easy to move around in once I got used to the arms. The fan is kind of loud but it inflates the costume quickly and keeps it inflated well.  Having someone hold the head up while it is inflating until there is enough air for it to stand on its own helps . There is good airflow inside the costume once it is inflated. It can however get a little warm inside  after a while if you are really active, especially running around outside in the summer. I really like the fact that there is a clip on the fan so you can clip it to the waist of your pants. It’s a little awkward if you aren’t wearing actually wearing pants (due to the heat in the summer) or if pants have an elastic waist. On those occasions, wearing a standard belt  (regardless of the pants situation) worked. The costume has held up well . The material is lightweight, but feels durable like parachute material. The clear window is easy to see out of although the range of peripheral vision is very limited.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and would buy another  if for some reason we ever have a need for more than one T-Rex.

  I bought this for pure unadulterated fun.  I'm a 54 year old woman and have wanted one of these for a couple of years.  I have worn it for several occasions and it was a blast.  My sisters loved mine so much, they bought one too.  Mine has a growling module in the palm of one of the gloves which was great.  The kids love this and the laughter is pure golden.  When you wear it, the legs really start at your own knees and the head extends about 2 feet above your own.  Vision is clear through the screen in the neck and movement is easy.  Remember, you're a mighty meat eating thundering T-Rex in this costume, but you also have the arms of a T-Rex, so don't expect to have a wide range of motion.  You will love this costume and have a blast.  I was NOT hot even though I wore this in the summer time.  One thought - use good batteries because the fan HAS to keep this inflated for you to have success.  Your costume will also NOT stay inflated if you don't have your arms in the sleeves and elastic around your wrists/arms so that air doesn't escape.  I'm sure this can be punctured but I was on the street, in the grass and even climbed a tree without damage.  The neighbors love this too.  Who doesn't love a T-Rex?

  I'm actually surprised how well the costume fit considering I'm on the shorter side on humanity. I can't speak for all heights here, but the comfort zone is broad--probably ranging from 4'10"" up to over 6' tall.  From a width perspective, anything more than a size 44 jacket is likely going to be a bit tight.The only detractors I can think of is that it can be a little difficult to see out of for longer distances and it seals well with little air escaping. This means it gets really warm in there and any gas passed doesn't blend quickly into the atmosphere. I've been hearing for years about how horrible my methane discharge was, but until I wore this costume, I never gave it much thought or consideration.  One medium blow from the back-facing fog horn was all it took. I almost threw up. I'm not saying that family, friends, children, neighbors, and passers-by are/were necessarily correct in their assessment of lethality, but after a couple hours sealed into this costume, I'm at least ready willing to concede there may be some validity.HDF

  This must be a Childs size! But I double checked the tag inside the costume and it even says adult standard size. I’m 5’7” and could not see out of the face viewer at all! It was way too low. After about 30 minutes (if that) I had to get out of the costume. Not only was the face completely fogged over but I wasn’t able to see my kids as they trick or treated. And after my six year old ran out into the street to cross it without looking, I decided Enough was enough. My friend that was with me stopped my kid but it could’ve been much worse. I was really disappointed this didn’t workout for me. This would’ve been a lot of fun but there is no way this is an adult size. I met up with other trex’s last night and seeing theirs compared to mine I realized that this isn’t my adult size that I needed. The quality seems pretty good of the sewing and zipper. The fan isn’t that powerful, yes I used fresh new batteries. But it doesn’t have enough power, remember I said the face viewer was fogged over. The painted/printed design on the material also had a lot of smudges. In several places. I just took pictures of a few. Would I buy this again? No, not for myself. For a child? No. The price you pay for what you get isn’t worth it. The fan is weak, the design is smudged and the roar device is way too quiet. I’d look for a higher quality item that might cost $10 more. It might be worth it!

  I purchased this for Halloween and it grabbed everyone's attention!  I also won best funny costume that day!  People just laughed all the time when they saw me tried to make copies or scan documents.  It is tough to use those little T-Rex 2 fingers to type email address on the scanner.  But I can take them off on my desk to type regular work.  If you worry about T-rex head is extended and may not able to fit in your cubicle, simply put the head on top of the monitor to rest so your eye level will be same to the monitor through the view window of T-rex.  It indeed was hot inside so you need to keep fan on all the time to feel cool down.  When you sit down on the office chair, just make sure to put the fan/wire on the side of waist so it operates well without you sitting down on it.  I am 5'2 I bought standard and it fits well except the leg.  It doens't full cover to my feet (See photos).  TuTu and the bow on the neck were not with the costume.  I purchased that separately from other vendors.

  Jurassic Park is mine and my husbands' favorite movie series to watch together, so when I came across the various First Look prank ideas for the wedding day, the dino suit was instantly my favorite! I bought the dino suit, knowing it would inflate over the wedding dress so as to not touch my hair, makeup, or dress and mess anything up. As you can see in the picture, the suit had the reaction I had hoped for!The suit itself takes about 10 minutes to fully inflate (though I recommend turning the pump on a little bit before you want to put it on so you don't have to fight the material to get it on properly). There are footy holes in the dino feet so your feet can go all the way through, with tight elastic around your ankles to hold the air inside (so you can put your shoes on AFTER you get the dino suit on, thank goodness). The sound box is in the palm of the right hand so all you have to do is squeeze and you are making ferocious velociraptor sounds (it wasn't as loud as I had hoped it would be, but you could still hear it)!The head is kept upright with an elastic headpiece that fastens almost like a helmet around your head. But once it's fully inflated, the head pretty much stays upright by itself and the headpiece is mainly for keeping your face properly positioned in the window so you can see the things you almost run into right before you run into them anyways because you're not used to having a tail.The reason I'm giving the velociraptor identity suit 3 stars instead of 5 is because right as I got out of the golf cart (I was hunched over, not quite sitting but not quite standing), the zipper busted, letting out most of my air and refusing to get back on the track. My dad then held it closed to blow up enough to finish the first look, but that's why in the picture the head looks like it's about to fall. Because it was.It was a great idea and I've seen people use these all the time with much better luck than I, apparently, but I was a little disappointed that it broke on me, especially on the wedding day and not the time I tried it on to make sure it worked properly where I could have fixed it!Oh, and don't plan on being inside it for very long. It's a sauna in there. Pretty sure I lost 5 pounds in sweat in the 15 minutes I was in it, which is good for your wedding day I guess.

  I’m a kindergarten teacher and we’ve been learning about dinosaurs. I promised them a visit from a dinosaur and purchased this costume for the exciting event. The package arrived the night before I was suppose to wear it to school, since that was the last day of our dinosaur unit.The costume was missing the battery pack to operate the fan to inflate the costume. Leaving it completely useless. I spent 3 hours and went to 8 different stores to try to find a way to inflate this costume and no one could help because the costume uses a fan that was made back in the 1800s. To add the cherry on top, it was also missing the gloves... not that it mattered because the costume was completely useless anyways.I will NEVER buy from this supplier again. Useless and disappointing.

  I was expecting to get the teen version thinking it would be between a child and an adult size since I’m 5’2. It was way to too small and they sent me the child size instead. The picture kind of mislead me thinking there would be plastic where the face was, but there was a hole cut out to show the face. I put it on my little brother who was 4’1 and it fit him perfectly though! The head hole for it was too small so we did have to cut it for him, but overall it aired up and everything.If you’re wondering how it fit me in a child’s size, the feet part went up to my thigh and the gloves with it were a bit snug. I was disappointed because it was supposed to be my Halloween costume, but my lil bro enjoyed it instead. So if your over 4’8, get the adult size!

Its the best $50 ive ever spent on something. We also have incorporated this into a team building event for work. I live near water so the mosquitos are insane this year. the only way i can water my plants or mow is with this costume on. The people walking on the path get a real kick out of it. I have worn this to stores when Covid was first a thing. Also a good time. I have rollerbladed as t rex, I have wrapped presents as t rex, and i go shopping as a t rex. I love this thing. I will admit, its  a little hard to see, and it gets hot in there, but i bought a usb mini fan that i plug into my cell phone and stick it in the suit with me. Tons of fun.

  This is the Tyrannosaurus costume that I wore for Halloween. My 11 year old son was Deadpool and I chased him around our town. Hilarious stuff. We managed to get photographed and featured in the local newspaper. Anyway, I am 5 feet 8 inches tall 180 pounds and have a 42 inch chest. If the costume was any smaller, it wouldn't fit. I recommend that you allow this costume to off-gas for a while before putting it on. The fumes from the vinyl material can be brutal. Also, this thing does NOT breath very well so it's like wearing a sauna suit after a while and the view ports get fogged up. You can probably reduce the condensation by applying no-tears baby shampoo. Be forewarned: If you ever wondered what it's like to be a character at Disney, get this costume. Kids and parents alike will give you all the high fives you ever wanted (some kids might try to punch you in the balls).

  My wife and I share this Amazon account, so I will allow her to offer her thoughts on this product since she bought it for herself. But first, I will say that the level of sheer joy in our home exponentially increased moments after she donned the costume and inflated it fully. Here she is:Want to know how to shake things up in an Infantry Division during 0630 PT Formation? Order this costume and show up to terrorize the lazy out of some Privates!I'll admit, when I picked the package up from our mailroom I was a bit nervous. It was small and seemed like it wouldn't possible be large enough to fit. Before I even opened the package I checked my order history on Amazon to make sure I didn't accidentally order the costume for children. I didn't. I was ready to have to return the costume as I tore open the package, but was pleasantly surprised to find an adult-sized t-Rex inside.Getting the costume on took some work. I don't recommend wearing boot-cut jeans under it for two reasons: first, the feet of the costume are open on the bottom so you can wear shoes without wearing the bottom of the costume out by walking on the material of it. To keep the airflow from escaping through the foot area, the ankles are elastic... and that elastic is pretty snug. If you're wearing boot-cut jeans, there is a lot of material to get the elastic around. I was able to get the elastic over the jeans with some careful manipulation, but the ensuing bunching of the boot-cut jeans made for a pretty tight squeeze.I was worried about how thin the material of the costume is. We live in South Korea, and the temperatures are getting down in the high 20s (F). With a fan blowing air around the inside of the costume, and 20*+ weather outside, I was nervous that the costume would be miserably cold to be in. On the contrary! I was warm and close to sweating after wearing the costume inside our 68* apartment for less than ten minutes. This comes back to the second reason boot-cut jeans may not be a great idea. Go for something a bit thinner... maybe running capri pants?I have only worn the costume for a silly 20 minutes in our apartment to see how it fits and how it works. For your reference, I am a 5'9"" curvy woman of 190 pounds and it fits well once it's on. Getting it on took a little bit of manipulation because there is no stretch to the material (specifically, putting my arms in the armholes after having my legs in completely). It wasn't a huge struggle... and I was able to don the costume by myself, but I will say that the costume does take a small amount of thought to put it on.I intend to wake some Soldiers up at PT in the morning in this costume. After doing so, I'll post an update to this review to reflect my thoughts. As of right now, this looks to be a wonderfully sturdy, hilariously fun costume. I can't wait to see what shenanigans we can make with this fellah!

  My kids both wanted to be dinosaurs for Halloween this year.  The my 13 year old went with the T Rex, and the 10 1/2 year old chose this velociraptor, and the sizing is tough, because you have to be really short for the child's one to fit, and he was about 3"" too tall.  I figured being too tall would be worse than having it large, so even though he's only 4' 9"" or so, we went with the adult size.  He JUST BARELY can wear this without it just being too large.  He's a tiny kid, so it take a while to get the thing to inflate around him, and the motor has a bit of a problem keeping it adequately inflated so it is stiff enough to wear.  That being said, these type of suits are never going to be easy to move around in, that's kind of the point.  The issues my son has with it is 1) the zipper is in the back instead of the front like with the T Rex one.  This makes it very awkward to get into and zipped without assistance.  2) the T Rex has removable gloves, so you can wear them or not, and the velociraptor has its hands attached.  I was going to cut them off and sew elastic to the wrists to have it like the T Rex, but then we discovered that there is actually velcro at the wrists so you can pop your hands out.  This is nice except the reality is problematic because for starters, you have to close the velcro as tight as you can around your wrists to keep the air in, and the velcro is scratchy as all hell and hurts the wrists.  Not only that, but the velcro section is tight to even get a 10 year olds hands through, and putting them through is a scratchy experience too.  We cut the toes out of a couple of socks so he could put them on his wrists to cushion from the velcro, and those makeshift wrist guards should make it wearable, but it also has the added detriment of having floppy second pair of hands next to your hands when you put them through so you can actually use your hands.  So, I would recommend staying with the T Rex version.  It is just designed better.  Not only the above, but the velociraptor also has a longer head/nose.  So the nose is often dipped down more into the field of view, making it harder to see.  Granted, this might not be a problem if a full sized adult was wearing the adult costume, but I'm here giving my thoughts so there it is.  It's still pretty dang cool, and fun, so I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3.  Just buyer beware with this one.

  Where to begin with this gem. This was the 3rd t-Rex I bought. I now have a family of t-Rex outfits, and suffice to say we stole the show for our Halloween party. I will say, you have to be on the shorter side of life in order for this to fit. There is plenty of room once inside, but getting in can be a bit tedious. Don't expect to eat, or drink while wearing this. It stays surprisingly cool as well, as there is a constant intake of fresh air. If you can find it for a great price, I'd snatch it up. I have seen this fluctuate from $50 to over $200.

  Got the costume today, and couldn't resist putting it on. I'm about 6'1"" and around 180lbs and it fit just fine. Took a little bit of maneuvering to get into it, but plenty of room once I was inside. Your hands and feet have elastic around the wrists/ankle, and there's a fan inside which inflates it (pretty quickly) and is powered by 4 AA batteries which you have to provide. It also comes with two ""claw"" gloves. I was able to walk around in it easily, though because it is sealed it gets hot pretty quickly inside of it, so be prepared for that.One note on taking it off - once you unzip it or shut off the fan the air rushes out and it collapses on to you. If you're someone on the claustrophobic side make sure to prepare yourself for it since it takes a few seconds to actually get off.But so far this thing is awesome and I'm looking forward to using it on Halloween and many other occasions!

  Reminds me of my first sewing project in H.S. Home Ec ... I'm an adult. 5'5"", avg wt.,T-Rex feet stopped mid-shin; arms came only halfway too; the shoulders were so narrow I couldn't zip much past my waist & only if I hunched over. There's extra material, but I'm guessing that accommodates inflation. Basically, it's sewn all wrong. Read thru reviews - some people happy, others in the same boat I am, disappointed and returning. Amazon needs to exert MUCH better quality control before wasting everyone's time & money, including their own with defective returns. I'd still reorder if I knew a different vendor who took care to manufacture a decent, sellable product and one FAMILIAR with ADULT U.S. sizing made it. But how in the world would I know that? This one, however, is TRASH! Ruined my Christmas surprise.

  Of course, I hopped onto the bandwagon and got this to surprise my kids on their first day of school. We had fun with it.This costume inflates with a build-in fan that runs on AA batteries, which is fantastic since I was dreading having to blow this thing up myself. It inflates within a minute or two after you get into it and turn it on.It's a bit awkward to get into, but if you put it on like a pair of pants (without shoes first, as there's not a lot of clearance for the foot holes), get your arms into the arm holes and then flop the whole thing over your head, zip it up, then turn on the fan, it's not too bad. Takes me a few minutes to be ready to be the king of dinosaurs and become unable to enjoy a game of Patty Cake.You will SWEAT like crazy in this suit. There's ZERO ventilation outside from that small hand-sized fan that brings in air to keep it inflated. When I used it to pick up my kids from school, I was drenched with sweat just being in an athletic shirt and shorts... but then again, it was 90 degrees with high humidity that day. If you want to go trick or treating on Halloween, I'd feel safe wearing very little with this on.There is a little viewing window and you can see pretty clearly what's going on... but just in front of you. There's no peripheral vision at all.I am 5'7"" with a thin, somewhat athletic build and the adult-sized costume fit me pretty well.The suit itself seems cheap and ""Made in China"" flimsy, so I had my doubts... but it hasn't busted a hole yet, and the tail drags on concrete, asphalt... everything. I haven't done any skydives without a parachute to test its durability, but for less than $50, it's already worth the gag I wanted it for.UPDATE 20180926: Not happy. The fan already busted. I've used this ONCE. Go figure that you can get replacement fans for $15... but still, only one use isn't very good. I took a look and noticed why it died: poor soldering, which allowed for one of the wires to lose contact with the fan motor (see photo). After re-soldering the contact points, it started working again, so that's good... but having to fix this in the first place is kind of a downer for something that relatively costs so much.

  This was the best Halloween costume ever!! We bought it for my 10 year old son who is about 4’10” and it was slightly big on him, but the kids version sounded way too small. I think the parents trick-or-treating with their kids loved it the most! He had a lot of requests to run around and parents talking about what they would do with one as adults. It feels hot inside for a minute but the fan is super helpful. Because my son is a little small we had trouble keeping his face in the window but he managed, and it is an adult costume so totally not unreasonable. He LOVED his costume and says he wants to wear it next year as well, and even wanted to make sure I sent photos to his teacher because he was so proud. It held up surprisingly well as you could hear parts dragging on the sidewalk while we were walking around but it never got a hole or anything which is awesome! My older daughter was not trick-or-treating but still went up to the door with him to hold his tail because he kept knocking things over! The sound plays a few times also, but it was a pain getting to the battery pack! I would definitely purchase again. Maybe next year we will be a family of dinosaurs!

  The only minor complaint is that the zipper can be a little temperamental, and it actually broke within the first 10 minutes of wearing it. Luckily, my sister is a seamstress and knew how to fix it on the fly.The issue I found with it, is that it get SUPER hot inside, and the little viewing window fogs up really easily. Every time I opened the zipper and emerged, I was dripping with sweat and my hair was all kinds of static and wild.If you want to scare children and dogs, I recommend this. If you're in introvert and want to go do something wild and fun, I recommend this. If you just want to get a group of your friends together and terrorize the town, or go to a festival and put on a costume and a tutu (like I did) and do silly things while lots and LOTS of people come up and ask for a picture, I fully recommend this!

  I wanted to write a review because sizing info is so hard to pin down on this costume.  After much debate on whether or not we should risk the youth version of this or try the adult size for a 9yo, we ended up going with the adult version and it's perfect!  He's 9 years old and 4' 6"".  He can see perfectly.  The costume is comedic, which is exactly what he was going for.  I wouldn't recommend this for a party where there a lot of activities or isn't much space though.I have this four stars because the fan was a little disappointing and it took a long time for the costume to inflate.

  This was the most money I had ever spent on a Halloween costume, but it looked high quality and it was the official Jurassic Park T-Rex and my son was going to have the same costume as his friends so there would be a bunch of dinosaurs running around. We tested it as soon as we got it. Worked as it was supposed to. Made him take it right off and kept it packed up until Halloween night. Halloween night, got to the friends house, he put his costume on. The other boys put theirs on, but only minutes later started having trouble with the fan not pushing enough air to fully inflate their costumes. The other dad sat and worked on them for about 20 minutes. While we waited, we went to the first house and while posing for pictures, my son's also started deflating. All 3 boys had to scramble and find some masks just to look like they did SOMETHING for Halloween. And my batteries were my ""good batteries"", brand new. There was no reason this should have ruined our Halloween night.

  I just love my big ole dinosaur costume! Why did I buy it? just because it makes me happy and is so stinking cute....that and possibly a mid-life crisis since I am 55 years old. I decided to scare my BFF (a cop) the night after I got it when he was getting out of his car. I was waiting behind the house and once I was sure he didn't have his gun I came out from the dark making what I percieved to be dinosaur noises. Being a bit of a crabby guy, he just kept getting stuff out of the car while never taking his eyes off of me and looking at me like I was an alien. Then after I made a couple of somewhat inappropriate advances towards him as he was trying to walk in the house he couldn't help but smile.  The next afternoon I put it on again and started doing lunges, squats, running in place in the livingroom. Try as he might, he just couldn't take his eyes off of me or keep a straight face.  I plan to wear it around my yard this weekend and wear it to work in the near future. This is a must have for any woman's wardrobe!

  Sadly, only one star because my kid couldn’t use it for Halloween. I ordered this costume several weeks ago and when my child was trying it on we discovered that the zipper was broken. I returned it and immediately ordered a new one. When the new one came in, there was once again problem with zipper alignment. It’s a different problem but it still has to do with how zipper is sewn in. So returning the second costume. Very sad, because otherwise this looked like a high quality item made of good material with sharp graphics. The only way to make this work if the zipper is broken is to completely and totally tape the zipper seam shot. If you make it airtight  enough with tape, you have a chance of it bowing up correctly... But in this case it is not suitable for a child because they would not be able to move around with tape all over. In any case, when you’re paying this much money for a costume, you wanted to work as expected.

  When our Dinosaur costumes arrived (we purchased T-Rex & the Gray Velociraptor), we had to try them on immediately. Since family was visiting, everybody wanted in on the fun. We range is height from 5""5"" to 6'0"" & they fit all of us. The air blower takes 4 AA Batteries & works very well, filling the suit faster than you'd think it would for the size of the blower. Since the purchase, these costumes have provided hours of fun:1. surprising the grandchildren at their house2. ""pole dancing"" dino party (we have videos-hahahahaha)3. parties4. BBQs5. Waving to cars as they drive by has been a blast6. Kids really get a kick out of seeing these dinosaursEverywhere we've taken them people want to try them on & what a great time we've had with them.

  Although this costume it labeled as fitting ""Adult - Standard"" for the size, most adults will probably have a hard time wearing this properly.  I'm not overly tall being a 5'11"" tall male but when I put this on, the feet end up just below my knees (see picture).  This is disappointing, especially being a product that is supposed to be endorsed by the movie franchise.  In my opinion, you'd have to be closer to 5' tall for this to fit correctly.The first one I bought through Walmart (it was cheaper than on Amazon), but returned it due to the feet being just below my knees...so I thought it was just defective.  So I bought one from Amazon, but it's the same way - too short!  The leg inseam to the costumes elastic ankle is only about 12 inches.  Now if I had narrower shoulders, I might have been able to pull my head and shoulders up into the costumes head area some more & possibly gotten the feet closer to mine.  But it's sized in typical Chinese dimensions, so everything is smaller than what is considered ""normal"" here.I still like the overall concept and look of the costume, so I'll just modify it to fit in my spare time instead of try and return it for a second time.

  I love this T-Rex suit! The minute I pulled it outt of the bag, I was laughing! The suit is made very well and appears to be high quality. Luckily the fan pump was working on the suit so I was happy!As far as size... I am 6'6 and 230 so the suit was a little small for me but make it work! My ankles and a little of my legs show some, so I will probably wear longer socks when I wear this costume out. The costume does get warm, but the fan inside really helps not make the suit stuffy.I would highly recommend this TRex suit for anyone that is thinking about purchasing it.

  I would say this costume is the opposite of comfortable. I would classify this costume as dangerous.I purchased two of these costumes for my wife and I to wear, to surprise my 3 year old on his birthday. We also purchased a non-inflatable costume for him so we could all wear matching costumes and dance to his favorite songs on his birthday. Sounds like a fun time right?It was great for about 3 minutes. As the miniature fan blows air into the costume the dinosaurs head will rise until you can see through a plastic panel placed at the dinosaur's neck.The problem is the plastic panel is poorly constructed and has sharp plastic corners on each side. So as you walk in an inflatable costume, the head will bob because it's an inflatable costume so the plastic edges are wobbling around near your eyes. As a result the plastic scratched my eye and ruined my night. Luckily I wasn't bleeding. My neighbor is a Phycisians assistant. He told me the eye heals quickly and that i should be okay the next day. He was right. But I would not recommend this product to anyone. If the damage to my eye was more severe, I would likely have sued the company.Fair warning.P.s. amazon removed my first review despite the fact that this review complies with their guidelines. If they do not accept this review I will escalate the complaint and if that fails I will cancel my account.

  Ok. First of all, based on reviews, I did not think this would fit me, I figured I would need the plus size one. But it fit perfectly. I'm 5'8 and wear a size 16 in women's and this fit me. Yes, you have to do some twisting to get in it but it gets easier every time. I wore just a tank top and shorts and was sweating before it was fully blown up but I expected as much. I will say that the legs probably wouldn't fit someone over 6 feet tall, unless they have short legs. They were the perfect fit in me but with some room. I wish I had been able to actually wear it but my 2 year old grand was too afraid of it. I am saving it for when she gets older. But the neighbors got a good laugh when I was in the yard for a few minutes. I would buy this again with no hesitation.

  my husband has wanted one of these costumes for years. finally they halved in price and I scooped one up for a surprise. he has worn it at least once a week since. after seeing it, one of his friends ordered one and now they do t-rex things together: go to the bar, the bowling alley. he took it dancing at a club, it was a huge hit for the 30 min he was able to wear it before he almost literally melted. it IS hot inside. you will be drenched in sweat if the temp is above 40. and even if it's not.. the suit will still be warm inside and the water will condense in the head of the dinosaur and occasionally rain on you. the windows fog up. still worth it.my 8 yr old has worn it to dance in our driveway for his brother's schoolbus, and to amuse people in our subdivision as they drive to work. you can see them cracking up in their cars, it's hilarious. when son wears it, the haunches pretty much rest on the ground and he can just see out the bottom of the chest window. husband is 6', wide shouldered and 240#. I knew we would be pushing the limits of the suit but it does fit. his shoulders are up inside the neck a bit which makes for a really tight fit. and the legs end a little lower than mid-calf, but the feet flopping down help hide that.they've been posting t-rex exploits on facebook and everyone I run into comments on how much they like it. I thought these were pretty popular costumes, but I'm surprised how many people have never seen them.  my boss even got one after seeing the videos- for Halloween he stood still in his yard and pretended to be a blow up lawn decoration, then scared the crap out of people when they got near him. he's 5'9 and slight runner's build, it fits him perfectly.ONE CON: the seam above the zipper has let loose twice on our suit. I had seen this in the reviews. the first time I stitched it up and it ripped out again. the second time I stitched it up and also stitched the top of the zipper together (above the teeth, so it doesn't affect the working of the zipper at all). sewing thru the thicker material there holds everything together much better and that seam hasn't split since.

  Product operated as it should. Because it is so thin, I assume for the inflation purpose, I felt we had to be extra careful when entering it or walking around. It can definitely puncture if you aren't careful enough. Also had to be careful with the zippers because it felt like it could easily tear if someone was too forceful. Inflation wasn't instantaneous but didn't take long. If wearing for Halloween trick or treating, here is what we experienced. 1. If getting in and out of a vehicle when trick or treating it will likely have to deflate and inflate each time going in and out of the vehicle because the head is tall and tail long. 2. Getting inside of the costume be sure to have your child duck under the zipper to pull it over. If they try to stretch it over their head it may bust the zipper out. 3. It was a little of a challenge for my child to see where their feet were going. Had to be the guide for some moments. 4. The battery pack for the fan clips on the child's waist of their clothing. Be sure they can handle that being clipped on there. 5. Because walking in a balloon is awkward, my child was getting tired of the walking  way before the other children. Once it got dark, the whole visual issue got worse as well. Overall, we still enjoyed the humor of the costume and people enjoyed seeing it. Just keep the points above in mind and consider the tendencies and tolerances of your child before buying.

  Bought this for Halloween. More than I would have liked to pay for a costume but my son had his heart set on it. He is 5’4” and it was perfect for him. He could look out the lower viewing window. Seems decently durable. Made it though a couple hours of walking around and in and out of vehicle during Halloween. I am 5’7” and when I tried it on it fit fine. I was able to look through the upper panel.It was easy to use and figure out. It got tons of looks and my son had a blast.A few things I think they could improve on - a little more powerful fan. While yes it worked fine. It took a minute to re-inflate if he had to bend over for something.Only other issue was that there is a black mesh behind the plastic viewing pane- which helps hide your face. Only issue we ran into was that it was cold outside (approx 40 degrees) and it would fog up that viewing panel - since it had the black mesh on the inside it was kind of hard to wipe off. I would put my hand on the outside and my son would use his hair/head and push against my hand and wipe back and forth to wipe it off some. Also, once it was darker out he wasn’t able to see crap lol. While I must admit it was hilarious when he tripped and fell - (luckily he was fine).  But that it one downside. Can’t see your feet and hard to see when it’s darker outside.Overall I would definitely recommend this because we had some good belly laughs with it and my son had a riot.

  I read many reviews which helped me with sizing. My son who is 12 fit just fine in an adult size, had it been any smaller it would not have fit. I purchased three, one for myself and two for my kids.  The wow factor was great, lots of compliments and laughs and Jurassic World jokes. However getting around in these costumes proved problematic. You become over heated- so I recommend wearing a tank top and shorts- or something equivalent.  If you have long hair, put it in a bun, lots of static electricity in the head portion. The part of the costume where you see out fogs up a lot. We used these to trick or treat, and were exhausted by the time we came home. The kids did less then half of the houses they usually would do just simply do to the cumbersome nature of the costume and the continual fogging issue. However, with all that being said, these are fun costumes to wear- just not long term.

  If you are ordering this from the link that advertises ""Officially licensed Jurassic world t-rex costume fits a 42 to 44-inch jacket size with up 34 to 36-inch waist "", you will not receive that size. The package itself also listed up to a 44"" jacket size, but once opened, it was clearly not an adult size costume. My wife is 5'4"" (please, don't tell her I referred to her size as, ""clearly not adult""). She was able to get into the costume, but it was a bit tight height wise. I am 6', but meet the advertised chest and waist size advertised. Before buying, I had spotted a review from a fellow 6' buyer, who quoted the item was snug in the height, but worked. I think he may have purchased his from a different link selling the same item, or there is a very loose size variable in packaging. I somewhat suspected the product would be a bit short, but upon opening the package, I didn't even try to put it on. It would have been silly to try. I had hoped that ""Officially licensed"" would also mean accurately listed. Still, the shipment was fast, the material is as advertised, and the item is returnable.

  This is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. I’ve already recouped 60% of the cost by winning $30 in a costume contest at work. I also wore it to see my friends’ new baby and terrify their 18-month-old, as well as to a wedding rehearsal and dinner that were costume parties on Halloween weeekend. The perfect gift for any attention monger like myself. My two complaints that do not warrant a star being taken off are: 1) the wrist and ankle cuffs tend to ride up. It would be nice if they had a stirrup seen in to help keep them in place. I might find s way to do this myself. The mitts help keep the wrists in place a little better but there’s not much hope for the ankles. 2) I dropped the battery pack (my bad) and it split in half and one of the battery springs broke off and rolled away into the abyss off multicolored office carpet, never to be seen again. But I McGyvered it with the spring from a click pen and carried on to win my costume contest. Now off to panhandle on the streets by charging passersby to pose for pictures with me.

  Immediate fun. People were beeping their car horns, adults were laughing, kids were running for their lives. Ok the kids were crying but that's life.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does get hot inside and the windows will fog up. I would make sure you're hydrated and not wear it over a long period of time especially in direct sunlight.  Someone left a review and said so life like.

  Great costume, definitely do not wear if you like attention.Reason for 1 star off -- I wore this out treat-or-treating with my son.  Once the sun starts going down, it is very hard to see out of due to screening of the lookout portion, as well as that plastic portion fogging up.  It also has a plastic seam that, at least for me, kept rubbing on my forehead and became quite uncomfortable.  I would advise wearing a sweatband on your forehead and perhaps (sounds stupid but it works), a sock full of unscented cat litter to pull out the moisture from within the costume to prevent it from fogging up.

   My son wore this to his school's halloween party and danced the night away, whipping, nae nae'ing! He is a tall 10 year old so I had to go with the adult size (5'2"" and 96 lbs). Just had a long sleeve tee and jeans on underneath. He was toasty warm even before he started dancing.  Easy to put on but I recommend you do it carefully because the material seems thin and the zipper looks like it could get stuck if you zip it up too quick so take your time!

I know this zipper because I manufacture products with a zipper and these are really weak. With just a day before Halloween, I had to break out the sewing machine and replace the zipper to keep from spoiling the fun.Our friends daughter who got the same suit dropped the battery pack inside the suit and the wire ripped out. solder gun required to fix on the fly.For usability It turns into a sweatbox and the gloves get really hot even on a night that was about 35F.Positive side:The fan battery last a long time and the suit was a hit.Kids had a blast.The look is great.In summary, if the zipper was a bump up in quality I would have given this 5 solid stars even with the sweat.

  Got a lot of compliments on it when it was working good, the fan isn’t really strong enough to keep the dinosaur aired up if you walk around very much, so it tends to deflate a little bit and you have to stop and let it reinflate. Also it fit quite small I’m only 5‘10“ roughly, and I had to crouch down a little bit in order to see out of the little window that’s on it. It also rubbed my four head raw because of the excess fabric where the Jolle meets the neck inside of the costume, it was constantly rubbing on my four head and not very soft at all. Since I wore it when it was cold out the viewing window fogged up constantly also making it hard to see. It’s still a very neat costume and gets a lot of laughs, my wife cries whenever she watches video of me in it because she can’t stop laughing, so there’s some good and some bad, but in this case I think the good outweighs the bad.

  Really fun costume. I ordered the teen size because I am 5’2” and petite.  The legs were pretty short and that’s saying something, as I have short legs.  I had to wear black tennis shoes and socks to make sure they blended with the costume as the elastic cuffs rode up my legs a bit.  I wish the battery pack had it’s own sturdy pocket built into the suit.  But it doesn’t.  The fan is part of the suit and then you have this battery pack hanging from a chord and it’s heavy.  So I had to wear shorts that I could clip the battery pack to inside the costume.  It’s just awkward while getting in and out of the costume because you don’t want to tear it or anything so you’re trying to wrangle with the battery pack.  Other than that, loved it.

  The costume itself in regards to design is amazing.  We had purchased this for a big costume party and sadly my grandson was unable to wear it that day because the zipper broke after he tried it one, it was unrecoverable because the quality of the zipper was very cheap.  We had planned to return it but our grandson had his heart set so much on wearing it for at least Halloween night so I bought a 45 inch zipper (which cost about $8 plus a bit of effort on sewing for 10 minutes) and we modified it to fit perfectly in place of the old one.  Not only did this fix fit perfectly, it enhanced the design of the costume.  We had a happy ten year old who wore it on Halloween and was getting compliments left and right!  It was a hit and with the new zipper, we feel it may last us for years to come.  I gave this two stars but if they had the zipper we used, maybe 5 stars...but overall, nice costume but poor cheap product of a zipper and not convienent experience with bad timing.  {Look at Brown Zipper on Front}

  Do you have a need to scare police dogs? A need to look like a giant toddler T-Rex? Or maybe you just like to hide in the pillowy sheath that is the TREX? Then this is the costume for YOU. It's relatively quiet if your not the person inside the TREX and the batteries last for a surprisingly long time. Just be careful when you try to run away from said police dog, the crotch rides really low and you're more likely to ""waddle"" than run.

  It's a hilarious costume so I won't rate it lower.Hilarious costume fun to play in. This costume could fit different sized people from 4.5 to 6.5 feet tall. It packs up small.Things to be aware of:Included fan is just garbage - mine broke right away and I had to take apart to resolder the wires. It rattles and barely inflates the suit, plus is loud. I ended up finding a high flow 75+ CFM 120mm computer case fan and making a replacement fan housing out of a plastic tube. This was powered with 9V batteries and inflated the suit better and more quietly than the included fan.The suit is hot. Even my more powerful fan only helped a little. After several minutes you will want cool air.Rips can be repaired easily with duct tape on the inside, or Leukotape is almost the same orange and is extremely flexible and sticky.The sound unit is ridiculously overpriced. It plays one sound as far as I can tell and is not loud enough.

  This costume is so fun and hilarious! Our 9 year old had to have it for Halloween and we were excited to order it because it’s the kind of costume you can use all year long for fun. It’s not a one time thing.BUT, this thing gets super hot inside. It was pretty cold and misty on Halloween and our son ended up taking it off 1/2 way through the night trick or treating. He thought he was going to pass out. The window to see out kept fogging up and when I unzipped him, he was drenched in sweat head to toe!So, my advice for parents is this is not a good costume for trick or treating. It’s great for playing around and making funny videos for short periods of time. It’s not something you can keep on for more than 30 minutes.My son is 4’9”, 80ish pounds and we bought the teen size fyi

  hello my fellow amazon friends, As mush as I wanted this dinosaur costume to be a big hit it was a big disappointment. I hate to be the person who give this wonderful costume a ONE STAR but, I purchased the costume for a dinosaur theme party that I hosted for my son's  4TH Birthday. The shipment was right on time package came well packed and looked as expected but when I went to try it on it felt a bit small and I'm only 5'3 but as I proceeded I believed once it started to inflate it that issue would go away but unfortunately that never happen, why you ask? Well it seemed that the fan wasn't strong enough to keep it inflated even with brand new batteries hopefully something could be done. the saddest part was all the children kept asking whats wrong with T-Rex i was very disappointed.

  This costume was a hit at my three-year-old grandson's birthday party. He wanted a ""dinosaur theme"" for his birthday party so I thought this would be a great idea.

  I have just tried it on inside so far but seems great. When zipped up before turning on the pump, it seems like it might be claustrophobic but it isn’t at all when you use the pump.  FYI the pump is just this little lightweight square with a plastic belt clip connected to it, so it’s pretty easy to clip onto something you’re wearing.  Once you zip up and then turn on the pump, it takes maybe 1-2 minutes if that (maybe less than a minute) to fill up.  I’m 5’9” and I can put my head at either of the two areas with the clear plastic in order to look out (both around the dinosaur’s neck area). The head and mouth of the dinosaur are above my head completely so it’s nice and airy in there when the pump is going, and it’s even cool inside the dinosaur with the air going. Disclaimer - I haven’t run around in it so I don’t know if that will hold up. The dinosaur arms are pretty short but I think that’s the nature of the t-Rex - it seems like it’d be risky to try to pull your hands/arms up over your shoulders because I just don’t think there’s enough fabric there to allow that without possibly ripping the costume. The dinosaur legs came basically all the way down to my feet. There are holes in the feet, so the costume cinches around your ankles like cinched sweatpants would, and then the dinosaur feet basically overlay your shoes (the dinosaur feet are big enough that they completely cover your shoes so you really wouldn’t see what shoes someone had on). Your shoes then are completely outside of the costume, but everything else is in the costume except your hands and maybe a little part of your wrists/arms, but the costume comes with gloves for your hands. It’s a hilarious and awesome looking costume. I think someone 6’ or so would still probably be able to see through the top of the 2 areas with the clear plastic. Anything higher, you might still be able to fit in the open, airy head part of the dinosaur, but you’d have to scrunch to be able to look out of the plastic I think.

  Item was not the sound one that I purchased even though the item says it is. I know I purchased without sound but onto the costume.If you are OVER 6ft tall, do not purchase the one size fit. You will have to bend forward and literally walk like a trex because of how uncomfortable it is to wear it. My item was clearly defective due to the so called ventilation/air pump fan was not working properly. All you could hear was a bad motor that wasn't working to do its basic function. I'm going on a limb here but the seller of this must've sold used costumes, which makes sense why it was only $32. I did my best to act like a half deflated trex for my daughter's birthday party but next time I'll spend the extra cash and buy one that not broken.

  I'll start with a positive, the suit COULD look amazing.The fan I received with the suit was very underpowered I had to really fuddle with it to get it to even turn ON. And it was already attached which it was NOT supposed to be per the instructions... Leading me to believe I received one that had been returned by someone else, along with the fact the suit was not folded at all but rather crumpled up and stuffed in.I have a friend who had bought one, so I know how inflated it should STAY while moving. My costume struggled to stay inflated while walking.DO YOU KNOW what its like to have an entire children's birthday party get depressed at you because of a faulty costume?!Why did I get someone else's return?!I'm livid...

  Fun costume! Purchased for my nephews 4th birthday party - he loves Dinosaurs! He was a little scared at first thinking the Dino ate me....The costume is HOT, I wish there was an extra fan in there somewhere. Had it on for 10-15 minutes before I was soaked in my own sweat, literally a sweat box and maybe even lost some weight - haha! Granted, it was a summer day afternoon while wearing it outside.Recommend getting your feet in first, then your arms, then you kinda have to hunch back your way into it as you turn on the fan and zip it up. Fits me fine - I’m 5’5/110lbs.Super fun costume that I’m sure we will find things to wear it for in the future. Batteries are not included, requires 4 AA and you’ll need a small screwdriver to open the battery pack.

  Okay, so this was a crazy thing to buy but my daughter insisted.....It is awesome !  My daughter is only 5 ft 1 inch and she wore this to our Church Trunk or Treat festival the day before Halloween.  She was the hit of the night !!  All the kids loved her.  The costume fit well (we were concerned that she might be too short).  The only problem she had was due to the weather - it was near record breaking heat that day and very humid so her vision was fogged several times.  I finally gave her a towel to wipe the inside and that helped.  Once it got cooler outside (and the humidity dropped) she was able to breathe and not fog up her screen.  She walked around the parking lot area for hours and the costume held up just fine.

  My son wanted this for halloween.  He is 5'5 and 165 pounds at 12 years old.  When we got the costume we tried it on and found it was somewhat difficult to put on...awkward to say the least and def a 2 person job.  The costume came with all the correct parts and seemed to be made well however, on Halloween it didn't last more than 15 minutes.  We managed to go trick or treating at 6 houses and the costume began to fog up.  We had to stop to clean the view vent from the water accumulating and while doing so the costume ripped at the seam.  There was no pressure put on the seam it just ripped and wouldn't re-inflate as a result.  Needless to say my poor kid had no backup costume and ended up trick or treating in a t-shirt and shorts.  Worst of all, he had sweated so much inside the costume his clothes he wore underneath were soaking wet.  While this is a cute concept, it didn't work for us and was frustrating to have spent so much money only to have it rip and fog up. (sorry the photo is side ways, I can't get it flipped).

  If you are taller than 5' 9"" expect to hunch wearing this, there is a metal support wire that is in between the throat window and the lower head window that will be right at (or almost up) your nose, using the upper window puts it right up against your face (which gives you about 10 min of visibility before your breath fogs it up) hunching and using the lower window is fine, but your back will punish you the next day.It's a great costume however even with the 'I'm stuck in a plastic bubble of heat', I had people stop and take pictures of me when I walked my kid to the bus on Halloween (our communist school doesn't allow costumes for kids, go figure), and it fills up quickly and lasts a long time on the AA's, but height is a real problem, as this is very much designed for the lower side of adult height (god help you if you're above 6').

  Way too much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Jurassic T-Rex Inflatable for Adults is frickin' funny!~The fabric and zipper are great quality and will last for an entire event or multiple uses though you do have to watch for sharp edges just like most all costumes. Ya might wanna stay away from a smoking area, just in case because it would deflate and you'd look like sad T-Rex and no one wants that.~It doesn't look cartoon-ish as in colors or design, it looks like the picture with the browns and blacks dark enough as well as the mouth. You still wouldn't be mistaken for a real T-Rex so no worries there.~The cuffs and ankles have strong elastic though some reviewers mentioned they used tape to keep the air in. I suppose if you wear it to work every day it could stretch out but otherwise, it isn't a problem.~The viewing area is clear plastic under the chin so it's fun to try to walk through doorways or down steps since the head will flop all over making T-Rex look more...irritated.~It takes a couple of minutes to inflate (well, on an adult sized adult is wouldn't be as long) so when friends call from 10 minutes away, you can be ready to greet them in fabulous style.~It didn't get too hot or fog the view area but it's still snowing on and off and kept me warm. Summers would be a great way to lose weight if you wore it...roller skating? which I'd do around a lake up here just in case I needed to cool off. Hopefully no one will call animal control about that.SIZING:It runs a little small I think, I'm 5'3"" 115lbs and it was just right for viewing because you could only see my eyes and not my face, no need for tape on wrists and ankles holding the air just fine. I'd say it would probably fit someone comfortably 5'10"" 170lbs-ish though some reviewers haven't had a fit issue that are much taller. It would fit a general range of adult & teens as there was a lot of room in the rest of the costume which is why I put ""fit as expected"".The only drawback is the fan is really noisy, enough to where it bothered my Granddaughter so I had to take it off and couldn't hear people clearly that were in the same room. From the reviews, it wasn't something I expected to be that loud which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.Maybe I need to use some WD40 on it and see if it quiets down, otherwise, these are fun and have so many places to wear them just so people know you are the good kind of crazy.

  So, my husband and I purchased 2 of these for Halloween costumes along with 3 of the kids' ones. Hilarity ensued. I can honestly say there wasn't a single person who didn't laugh their butt off when they saw us all. My husband, who is 6'5"" was stretching the upper limits of fitting in this costume, but it's honestly easy to accomplish because the feet dangle and cover up a lot of space. I'm 5'9"" and it fit me just fine. It was easy to put on, and pretty warm which was perfect for our cold Halloween. The only part of this costume I didn't enjoy is the viewing screen for your face. It's a great idea in theory, but in practice it fogs up REALLY fast and makes seeing in the dark a little difficult. Also, should your child spill their pumpkin full of candy on the ground... well... just imagine 5 t-rexs with tiny arms trying to pick up all the candy in the dark. Nuff said.

  I was skeptical of the quality because of the price, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It was a bit awkward to get into the first time, but after watching a video online, I figured out that it's best to put the legs on first, pull them up like putting on a pair of pants, then sit down and basically ""bend in"" to the rest of the suit. Since I can't always count on having someone around to close it up, I was happy that the zipper is pretty easy to zip from the inside. I was also skeptical that the one small fan would ""blow up"" the suit, but in a couple of minutes, I was transformed into a T-rex that was almost too large for my tiny living room! Even though the air flow is good, I did take the advice from some other T-rexes and purchased a second fan that I've not installed yet. Not only good as a backup, I think it will help keep me cooler while wearing it. It wasn't terribly hot inside, but I was in an air-conditioned house. The battery pack is fully detachable from the fan making folding/storing easy. It is pretty compact when folded and will fit in a suitcase easily.

  I love this T Rex costume. I wear it a lot. I’m 6 feet tall and it fits well, someone taller then me might could fit in it but not sure on that. I have bought 2 of these. The first one wore out after about 2 years of wearing it all over the United States. One time I did have to get out of it fast because I was in high elivation and started having trouble breathing. But I have also been able to run in it for about half a mile or so before I stopped because of condensation. The one thing to use caution of with this though is to be careful when getting out. If you aren’t careful you can rip the material by the zipper. I did this and just sewed it back. You just have to make sure to lean over to avoid this. Overall, I would buy this again (I actually did). The price seemed to fluctuate on here so watch it for a little while before buying to get the best price. It’s best to not buy it around Halloween because the price seems to be highest then.

  This costume is hands down the best thing you could wear to any party, you will always be the center of attention!I've had it for a year now and have worn it on a few occasions besides Halloween. It's well made and the fan does it's job of blowing up the costume but I did wish the fan was a little bit more powerful because if you sit down a lot of the air comes out through the wrists and ankles and when you stand up it takes a while to inflate again.The biggest drawback to this costume is how hot it will get inside, and that the plastic window will fog up to the point that you cannot see out of it at all. Which is why I took 1 star off. I may add a second fan to it to help with this.I will say, women love this costume, if only women came up to me in person as much as they do when I have this costume on.....

  I'm 6 ft 2 in and around 185lbs and this thing fits great.  It takes a little bending over and wiggling to get the thing on, but once you get it over your head there is plenty of room inside and it fits great.  It does get warm quickly though, but I imagine if it was cool outside you would be just fine.I immediately used the costume to scare my wife as she came home from work.  It was a successful scare followed by some laughs.  I'm hoping it lasts for years to come as this thing will always be good for a laugh.In a year where everyone could use a little smile and a laugh I think this is a great thing to buy.

  I have to say that everyone loved this costume.  It was a huge hit for my sons Halloween  activities.  Saying that, it embodied the trick or treat mantra because while it was a treat for everyone watching my son, (especially when he ran, jiggling the dino-bootie and when he fell on his back and couldn't get up) he felt a little on the tricked side.  Keep in mind, he is 9 yo, but the window did fog up on him, and he had trouble seeing after dark.  We finally had him stick his head out the top of zipper and was fine.The costume stood up to a few hours of walking on sidewalks and road, as well as quite a few deflates and reflates.  I did have to do a minor repair at the top of the zipper, but to my surprise I was able to sew it, and it held up fine.Overall, it is a great costume, but remember to wear light clothes, because it is warm and it is probably better suited for a party than trick or treating,  and is built well.

  This costume looks great, but I’m confused by the sizing, and the size chart didn’t help. The reviews are confusing as well, probably because people aren’t mentioning what size they ordered.I’m a 5’6” woman, and I wear a size 12. I ordered the “Standard” option, and my costume said “one size” on the package insert. However, it was much too short in both the legs. It was plenty roomy enough in the body, but the feet were up at my upper shins. It was super short in the arms as well, but I think that’s how it’s supposed to be worn, with much of your arms up inside the body of the suit and very little sticking out, since a T-Rex has such short arms.Really weird how short in was in the legs.Super cute though.

  When I got this, the elastic at the left leg was ripped and so was the top of the zipper so unless I held them tight, the air couldn't stay in and keep its form on its own. I didn't realize it until I bought another to get it in time for Halloween, but this was definitely already used when it had gotten to me. The actual new one that I actually used for Halloween, was nicely packaged in it's plastic, the little dinosaur gloves were tied together and with a label, there was a nice quality picture showing the costume, and it didn't have batteries yet.When I first opened the original, I was so excited I didn't realize that it was just jammed into its plastic and there were already batteries in it showing that some stranger had already put this on. What the hell. The original is going to be returned, but it was funny how the original costed about $60 and took maybe 2 weeks to get to me whereas the new one was available for prime so 2 days AND it was $10 cheaper so I at least had that going for me.The new one is great though, great quality and got lots of laughs and high fives from wearing though had to fix the zipper since it busted open the 3rd time I zipped it up.

  I love this costume, I really do, but for an adult's one-size fits all, it is not for any adult taller than 5'7. As a 5'8 female I struggled to get into it without breaking the zipper. The length of the zipper isn't ideal for adults. It isn't about weight or size of the person, it is strictly the height. If you're on the all side, this particular dinosaur costume won't fit.

  This is a really fun costume. I got one for myself and for my dinosaur partner-in-crime. I'm 5 foot 5 and he is 6 foot 3.

So weather is a factor. But it feels pretty comfortable in the 70s. I could probably even do short trips outside in the 80s or 90s.We are going to use this for more than just Halloween.

  As advertised, arrived a day early. I got the one without sound. The picture on Amazon looks teal, but it is gray.To put on: Sit down & put your legs in first. Then open the velcro on the wrists so your hands can be out to finish dressing. If you don't have help, you will have to turn the costume to get it zipped. I hooked the battery pack to the collar of my T-shirt. It has an elastic head strap you put on, which is handy to keep the head upright.👉 BIG HINT: tie a string to the zipper pull tab, because the zipper is in the back.

  This costume was a huge success & made my son so happy.  He got a ton of attention at his Halloween party & the costume held up ok under his natural abuse.  It lost a star because of a few negatives, that only mattered a little to my son.  One was that the zipper came out of one side of the zipper fob right as he was about to go Trick or Treating in it.  I'm sure he pulled it too hard, but it was a little flimsy.  I was able to fix it and jam the zipper back together, and then tape the slight opening where the zipper was separated, but it's a critical component to hold the air in & he won't be able to wear it again because of this.  The other was that it's too hot and awkward for long walks, which should be expected because of what it is, so if this is a problem for you, you should consider that factor.  If he had listened to me about wearing something different to trick-or-treat in, then it wouldn't have been a problem for him.  Overall the costume performed as expected, was a decent quality (with the exception of the zipper problem), and it was definitely a favorite costume with his peers.

  This was hilarious,  we showed Jurassic Park as a drive-in movie at the fair grounds.  We had the right person with the greatest personality get in the suit.  At the beginning of the movie we had “Rex” handing out free bottles of flavored water to all the vehicles coming in..  During the movie, rex occasionally strolled through the rows of cars...keeping a safe distance of course.  Then when it came time to leave we gave Rex two traffic flashlights and he directed traffic....dancing all the time!  The suit was great.  It even made our Rex person walk comical.  We may only get to use this one time.... but the laughs were worth the purchase price.

   I wanted to give this product a one star review because I was promised 2-day shipping and got it 9 days later. The t-Rex costume was for Halloween and it did not arrive till Nov 1. That being said I went out to hurry and buy a one at the local Halloween shop and they had I but for 2x’s as much. I had to explain to my son what was going on and why he wouldn’t get to wear his costume. Through tears and feelings of aggression we both mourned the loss of our Halloween costume.The next day it arrived and we were so happy he wore it to the grocery store and has taken it off when needed. It works great and fits great will fit all family members 5 foot tall and taller we only get to 5’10”. We have so much fun with this costume and it will be used for more than just Halloween.

  This & the T-Rex were both purchased to surprise nieces & nephews & surprise them it did, but I think the adults had more fun wearing them, waving at peeps as they drove by & just having fun. The adults wearing them ranged from 5'5"" to 6' & it fit each very well. They are warm, so be prepared for that. This one has a sound maker, which was fun, but the T-Rex is silent. The material is a strong nylon feel, like a thin tent & so far have held up well. The air machine is small enough to fit in a pocket in the costume & worked very well. We played with them for over & hour & there is still battery life left.

  Ok, this thing does have some flaws but the funny factor outweighs all of them and had to give this five stars just for that.  My 13 year old grandson wore this for Halloween and it was the funniest thing ever and drew a lot of attention.  It is reported that it is difficult to run (funny to watch) and you don't have much use of hands with the gloves on.  This is pretty cool and has a built in fan that keeps it inflated.  It worked the whole time it was worn and runs on batteries.

  Let me just say.. the product idea and the amount of material given to pull it off is awesome. I was in love with it when I seen it online and loved almost everything about it when I received it today and tried it on. The only thing I don’t care for about it is that you really can see much head from a frontal view. It’s mostly the open mouth and you can’t tell what you’re looking at. The reason why I gave this two stars is because.. as I tried it on a second time to show fiancée.. the zipper came off. It looks impossible to put it back on and now I feel as if I wasted money!

  This costume's material seems a bit cheaper than the raptor one. I hope it lasts more than one night a year. If I can get 2 Halloween nights out of it I'll be happy. It looks great and is super funny to look at. Now. I sprung for the sound version with roars. I think it was like a $15-$20 add on. I tried to find reviews about the quality of the sound but couldn't. If I had to do it again I would not get sound. The sound consists of a small  hand held soundbox. For me I use the costume out in the yard during halloween and I wanted some sound effects but this will not do for the loud environmet that is my house on halloween. I shoulda saved my money and bought 2 small spears to attach to myself and plug it into an old Ipod or MP3 player.

  This is the first halloween in my 35 years that I didn't wear something hand made. I just didn't have time this year, so I bought this.I have a degree in costuming, and I have to say I'm impressed. While there are a few small tweaks (like reinforcing the underside of the tail against abrasion, adding foot stirrups, and adding some ventilation holes in the mittens, which I would tack to the sleeves) I would make, overall I am very pleased.It looks really derpy, and I kinda love that. BUT you can make it look more scary and realistic if you lean forward. Bent at the hip till you are looking through the very top art of the face window, the shape actually resembles a dinosaur more than a cartoon. I did this a few times, but it's hard on the back. Mostly I embraced the derp.I had so much fun threatening all the other dinos at our halloween parade (you have to have a plan for meeting other people dressed just like you!). We amused many as we had tiny armed battles (our huge heads prevented any real contact) and a few decided to be friends and we danced, which more people loved.Some wearing notes: It's a bit of learning curve getting in without worrying you'll blow the zipper (I get my feet in, crouch down, and flip it over my head, then zip up) but once it inflates (a minute or so later) it's roomier than you'd guess in there. Tons of head room for me (5'6"") . Now here's the downsides: it's a greenhouse. In the sun, you are baking. The window fogs up and you can't see anything but colored blurs. There is no ventilation in the mittens, and they practically fill with sweat. I'm cold-blooded. I like being warm... This is a bit too warm for day use of more than an hour. At night it was GREAT. My feet got cold, but the rest of me was comfy.The fan gave me about 6 hours of battery life over 4 days of use. Not great, but sufficient. Be aware that you need a tiny screwdriver to change the batteries, so be prepared for this with spares and tools.

  We bought both the V-raptor and T-rex costumes.  They are both hilarious and awesome looking.  The T-rex costume has separate gloves and zips in the front.  This means you can get into the costume yourself, turn the fan on, and then zip it up without assistance from someone else.  You can also actually take the gloves off and do things (ie. drink beer.)The V-raptor costume has blow up hands attached to it and zips in the back.  I have no idea why they put the zippers in different places, but with the blow up hands and back zipper you pretty much need assistance from another person to zip up.  You also cannot really do anything while wearing it with the blow up hands.  I was hoping to drink beer and hand out candy, but that probably won't work. LOL.

  The faux leather is thick and feels like real leather; something you'd use in a stage production or cosplay, this is NOT cheap junk you'd use for 1 Halloween and throw away.Pros:  It looks great for the Plague Doctor theme.  Easy to adjust to fit.  Great quality.Remember that any full-face mask will restrict your vision significantly:  you can't drive and moving through crowds is challenging.  This one has plenty of ventilation holes along the bottom of the beak but the eye lenses can still fog up.At a party you'll spend more time with it off than on, but it does look cool.  If you actually have to visit someone with plague, this will keep evil spirits and miasmas away.

  La verdad es muy cómoda y por el precio parece una de verdad.Contras:Si usas lentes será difícil ver, ya que terminarán empañados desde el comienzo.

  Dear Seller,I have now ordered this same item 3 times & it is becoming very apparent that you’re lacking in quality control when sending product to customers.Order 1.) my package appeared to have been previously opened & tried on (not a big deal), but then I noticed that the zipper was broken & the stitching around the base was ripped.It otherwise looked cute & decent quality for the price.But it runs VERY small. Definitely needed to size up 1-2 sizes. For reference I am 5’3” in height, with 26” waist, 36” hips, 34” bust and typically wear size XS-S.The size small I ordered fit around me, but was way too short in the torso - which is surprising because I’ve never considered myself to be tall at just 5’3” & I have a short torso. I returned this item & reordered in a medium in hopes that it will arrive intact & will fit my torso properly & w/out the dreaded cameltoe lol.Order 2.) Size Medium fit much better. The length is perfect & despite the legs being baggy around my thighs, calves etc, it would work....then I noticed that it was dirty. Maybe the grey stains across the front would come out if washed, but I don’t want to try & wash it then be unable to return & be stuck with a dirty item if the stains didn’t come out. So I decided to order a third time.Order 3.) the zipper was not stitched correctly so it is mis-aligned at the top once fully zipped. It’s just annoying!!! Plus I’ve noticed that the seller had increased the price since my initial order. I’m not sure if I should just deal with the flawed costume or try a 3rd time.Please stop sending damaged/dirty/flawed items. This is ridiculous.

  I ordered a medium originally based off the measurements, but the torso was very small so I returned it and got a large. The torso was still very small. Their size chart is very off I’m only 5’4 140 lbs and the large says it fits up to 5’10 which is very wrong.

  The costume is SO cute but the zipper is very low quality. I wear a size 4 in pants and a small in shirts. I ordered a small in this costume and I bent over and the zipper broke. I’ll admit, I’m sure all of the Halloween candy didn’t help but a zipper should hold up. Long story short, I had to find a last minute costume :(

  Small holes in the fabric when I opened and tried on. Size runs odd. Too small in some areas and others it fit correctly. Not worth the price. Front zipper kept sticking.

  My GF wanted this for Halloween. I'm glad we heeded others' reviews and bought a size up. She normally wears a small, but went ahead and go the medium. Medium was still a little snug, but it fit. Other than that, great costume!

  I hate the zipper. But love the costume. It is one of the skinny zippers and causes problems but other than that I love the fit and all

  It runs small and the zipper is terrible and really just barely works. With that said it’s a cute costume. Probably worth $12 not $40.

  Company is turning to GARBAGE!!! Don’t waste your money. Super crappy zipper. Small holes everywhere. Almost see through. I’m a small in every other item they make & I had to get a large & it still was tight. XL was better but only in some parts other area it still didn’t fit right. I have costumes from years ago & these new ones don’t even com close to what they used to be. Company has gone majorly down hill even in the onsies.

  Normally a med-lg.. Ordered lg to be safe. Pretty sure I'll be picking wedgie out for a week and this should be called camel toe costume. Is stretchy but made for a short torso. Would have cute otherwise. Returning.
