non verbal are anything that communicates but is not a word the public knows them as body language how we dress how we walk have meaning and we use that to interpret what's in the mind of the person my name is joao and for twenty five years i was a special agent with the f b i my job was to catch spies most of my career i spent within the national security division a lot of it had to do with looking at specific targets and then it was about well how do we get in their heads and how do we neutralize them our security is based on non herbals we look at the person through the peep hole we look at who's behind us at the at m machine we know from the research that most of us select our maids based on non verbal so we may think we are very sophisticated but in fact we are never in a state where we're not transmitting information there's a lot of myths out there the ones that stand out is if you cross your arms that it's a blocking behaviour that's just nonsense even when you don't like the person that is in front of you this isn't to block them out it's actually to self sue because in essence it's a self hug when you're sitting at a movie and you're watching you're going to cross your arm you're waiting for somebody you tend to do this what's interesting is we do this behaviour more in public than in private the other one that really stands out is as we think about something we may look in a certain way as we process the information we may look in another way it's certainly not indicative of of deception and it really shouldn't be used that way all we can say is the person is processing the information the other misconceptions are that if the person clears her throat touches or nose or covers her mouth their line we do these behaviors as self soothes hither pacifying behaviours scientifically and empirically there is just no pinocchio effect and people who prattle that and say well we can detect deception because the person touches or nose or covers their mouth that's a sheer nonsense we humans are lousy a detecting deception espinosa is often nowhere near what we see in movies and in one of the cases we had information from another country saying you have an american we think is actually a mole who somehow entered the united states is able to pass us in american budes here working for a hostile intelligence service and just fortuitously he was video rapped coming out of a flower shop or looking at the video and everybody in the in our small unit we were saying well there's not much there you know he's coming out of the shop getting in his car and i said stop the film right there just as he came out of the shop he took the flowers and most americans tend to hold the flowers by the stock so that the flowers are up this individual took them and grabbed the stock and then held the flowers so that they were facing down and i said that's how they carry flowers in eastern europe rather than confront him about are you a spy i decided to do what called the presumptive so as i sat there with him i said would you like to know how we know then he had this look on his face and i said it was the flowers and then he confessed when i came into law enforcement i thought it was all about the confession it's really about face time in my twenty five years in the f b i it was a rarity that a person didn't eventually reveal what i needed to know because we would sit down and have these very lengthy of conversations i look at behaviours to do an assessment what is this person transmitting in relations to any stimuli my further questioning comes from my observing these behaviors the first thing i look at is i look at the hair does it look healthy does it look well groomed that forehead is very interesting because a lot of times we reveal stress a lot of the things that we have gone through life are often etched in the forehead i look at the eyes to see if they're red or not enough sleep the small area here between the eyes called the global it's one of the first areas that reveals information to us most often when we don't like something we do that bunny knows of i don't like we don't really know what our lips look like and we tend to compress them when something bothers us when something really bothers as we tend to suck them in the vendible look at the cheeks we may do something like this will will rob our tongue against the inside of the cheek but when we try to hide it then it tells me that this person is trying to do some perception management and if they are i want to know why at the neck i want to see if there's any head tilt because head tilt the person is more relaxed the minute the head tilt goes away there's usually some issue i'm looking at the shoulders you ask somebody a question they don't know both shoulders shoot up very quickly and then i look at the hands when something's troubling us we tend to stiffen our fingers interlace them and almost like a teepee we move our hands back and forth very slowly this is to be differentiated from when we do the steeple which we do in this position when somethings that issue we tend to put our hands on our hips and we become very territorial this is called arms akimbo but look how it changes when we put our thumbs forward and then it becomes one of more of i'm inquisitive but i also look for any behaviors of ventilating because men tend to ventilate at the neck and we do at the very instant something fathers us and then i look at the legs to see if there's any brushing of the legs with the hands which is again to pacified and then the feet do i see any behaviour such as wiggling of the feet kicking of the feet if i asked a question and all of a sudden the feet withdraw and are crossed perhaps the person feels a little threatened by that question so when we study on verbal it's not about making judgments it's about assessing what is this person transmitting in that moment it really is looking at an individual and saying what are they transmitting we're all transmitting at all times we choose the clothes that we wear how we groom ourselves how we dress but also how do we carry ourselves are we coming to the office on this particular day with a lot of energy or are we coming in with a different sort of pace and what we look for our differences in behavior down to the the minutia of what is this individual's posture as their walking down the street are they on the inside of the sidewalk on the outside can we see his blink rate can we see how often he's looking at his watch i know your blank rate is around eight eight times a minute but you don't know that you're not sitting there counting all these things factor in because they're transmitting information now it's up to us to then use that information to say okay we need a martial resources to be on that individual right now so most western culture's the first time people touch as when they shake hands touching becomes that important because we can always remember a time when we shook hands with some one and we didn't like that it's also the first time when our bodies release these bonding chemicals that say i like this person or i don't like this person so handshaking is both necessary and essential in most cultures ladies' joe navarino a laura how are you and you are katisha how are you let me ask you this let's pack up a little bit is this comfortable for you yeah it's a little bit more comfortable but it's not for you is it all right thank you all right so keep talking what we've done here is we've talked about the importance of space and comfort they don't realize is how much further apart they are now standing and it's because we have brought the subject up to make them comfortable about saying hey it's o k to be comfortable at your perfect distance and so now we see when they rock they rock away from each other and they create this space if you notice their feet tend to move around more there's a dynamic going on here where they're kind of trying to find what what is the perfect space what is the perfect distance and we know that they are unsettled because of the high degree of movement that's that's going on poker's an interesting game the similitudes of sitting across from a spy or sitting across from players it's their reactions to a stimulus we have behaviours indicative of psychological discomfort that we use at home at work or at the poker table so we're going to take a look at poker players and some of the body languid that you'll find at a typical poker game well pause it right there so one of the things that you first noticed is that when a table is called this is the first time many of them see each other this is a great opportunity to be looking for behaviours indicative of discomfort we're going to see the individual shifting in his chair we're going to see one individual reaching over and grabbing his shoulder the woman in this case her shoulders are rather high this is a great opportunity even before the game starts to collect poker intelligence a guy what is good so we'll stop right there look where their hands are at here we're looking at player number two in number three and we noticed right away that their hands are on top of the cards some players will cage their cards some players will put their hands directly on top and press them down and they may do that because the cards have now increased in value clair number one tends to keep his hands very close to his body clare number four she's actually withdrawn her hands from the table because when we like things we tend to move our hands forward when we don't like things we tend to move the hands away so as we look at player number three i'm often asked about players who shuffle their chips what you're really doing is self soothing and this just helps you to make it through the game and that's really all we're looking for i come okay so we'll stop right there play number five is sitting there arms cross you don't see a lot of activity that doesn't mean he's not transmitting a lot of information on down the line i want to see where those thumbs of his are because he holds them very close when nothing's going on but does that change as the game evolves if you're looking at non verbal it's often useful to look at him at double the speed because all the non verbal that are critical jump out at you as though it were a caricature i shall stop right there the woman in position number four you see her head moving around quite a bit player number three you see a lot of activity with his hands when we look at player number five now his hands are fully out this is as far as we've seen them before at this point we know that he's engaged and that he's interested now the game is out in the open seventy five to eighty per cent of the information we need is sitting out there what you often see is everybody's looking at their own cards or looking at the community cards rather than looking around you should be looking around to see what was the reaction because you're going to see that reaction again you know and poker we used to say that you can have a poker face but i countered you can't have a poker body somewhere it's going to be revealed when i was in college in the early seventies there were really no courses on novel communications quickly realized that to a great extent it's really about what you can interpret from behaviour and so we talk about not verbal because it matters because it has gravies because it affects how we communicate with each other and when it comes to non verbal this is no small matter we primarily communicate non verbally and we always will
